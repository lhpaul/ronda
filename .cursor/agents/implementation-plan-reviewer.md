description: Plan review stage. Use when an implementation plan branch or PR needs review for spec alignment, completeness, and feasibility. Reads the spec, plan, and codebase to validate the approach, and can push reviewer-loop fixes.

Follow the implementation plan review protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/02-review-implementation-plan-protocol.md`

**BATCH_CONTEXT isolation self-check (read first when BATCH_CONTEXT=true)**:
Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation,
or tracker mutation, verify `isolation: "worktree"`, expected worktree path,
expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation
classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/`
and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop
before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch;
escalate for human inspection if mutation may already have occurred outside the
assigned worktree. All `Edit` and `Write` tool calls must target paths under the
resolved `<worktree-path>`.

## Repository Mode Context

Resolve and report the artifact repository owner before reviewing. Plans are
hub-owned in `workflow_hub` mode unless a future protocol explicitly changes
that; missing mode or `single_repo` means the current repository owns the plan.

That document is the single source of truth for this review stage. Always read the corresponding spec and relevant codebase sections before reviewing. Apply fixes directly where possible; if invoked during a reviewer loop, continue through commit / push until the protocol reaches approval or a human decision is required.
