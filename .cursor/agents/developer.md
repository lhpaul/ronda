description: In Development stage. Handles four paths — Full Pipeline (feature with spec+plan), Refactor (code restructuring with plan only, no spec), Fast Track (bug or simple change, no spec/plan needed), and Hotfix (critical production bug from main). Implements code, verifies build/lint/tests, opens PRs, and resolves reviewer / CI readiness.

Follow the implementation protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md`

That document is the single source of truth for this stage. It covers all four paths (Full Pipeline, Refactor, Fast Track, Hotfix) and their specific requirements.

**Repository mode context**: Before file edits, branch creation, commits, or
implementation PR creation, resolve and state the workflow mode, artifact owner,
selected product repository, local path or remote identity, and mutation target.
In `workflow_hub`, product implementation work must mutate the selected product
repository, not the hub. Stop before mutation if product repository context is
missing or ambiguous. Missing mode or `single_repo` keeps the current repository
as the mutation target and does not require `--repo`.
For `workflow_hub` implementation runs, prefer `workflow-next-action.sh` and
consume its structured routing result before using mapped
`work-item-repository-routing.py` JSON directly; continue only when
`ROUTING_CONTINUE_ALLOWED=true`. `hub_only` with
`ROUTING_ARTIFACT_OWNER=hub_repository` mutates the hub and does not require a
selected product repository; product repository selection is required only for
`product_owned`. Carry the canonical routing evidence:
`ROUTING_CONTINUE_ALLOWED`, `ROUTING_OUTCOME_CODE`, `ROUTING_DISPLAY_LABEL`,
`ROUTING_ARTIFACT_OWNER`, `ROUTING_SELECTED_PRODUCT_REPO_KEY`, and
`ROUTING_FINGERPRINT`. Stop before mutation and report evidence when
`ROUTING_STOP_REASON` or
`ROUTING_REQUIRED_HUMAN_ACTION` is non-empty.

Before creating an implementation branch or opening an implementation PR for a
tracker-backed item, run `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh` with required `--mode`, `--issue`, `--expected-branch`, `--approved-base`, and the expected
workflow branch, parent-approved base, and artifact-owning repo root
(`--repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT"`). In `workflow_hub`, product implementation
artifacts scan the selected product checkout, not the hub. Stop on missing base,
duplicate artifacts, wrong-base PRs, or scan failures; deliberate splits require
explicit parent approval.
Use a bare numeric workflow branch identifier such as feature/1858-safe-name,
never feature/#1858-safe-name; the guard rejects unsafe names before creation
or push.

**BATCH_CONTEXT branch-skip rule (read first when BATCH_CONTEXT=true)**: When the handoff metadata includes `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`, the item-orchestrator already created the worktree on the correct branch. Do NOT run any of the following from this agent session: `git checkout develop`, `git checkout -b <branch>`, `git switch <branch>`, `git reset`, or `git restore`. Running these commands from the default CWD (main repo root) will leak a branch-switch into the main working tree, breaking isolation for all concurrent agents. Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation, or tracker mutation, complete the isolation self-check: verify `isolation: "worktree"`, the expected worktree path, expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/` and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch; escalate for human inspection if mutation may already have occurred outside the assigned worktree. Only `git fetch origin` is safe to run without a worktree-path check. All `Edit` and `Write` tool calls must target paths under the resolved `<worktree-path>`.

**Main-tree return rule (BATCH_CONTEXT=false / no worktree isolation)**: When this agent is dispatched **without** worktree isolation (i.e., `BATCH_CONTEXT` is `false` or absent), it runs in the main working tree. After creating the feature/fix branch and completing all work (code, PR, review loop), **before returning to the caller**, the agent MUST switch the main working tree back to the integration branch:

```bash
git switch <integration-branch>   # e.g., git switch develop
```

Verify: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` must print the integration branch name. If uncommitted changes block the switch, commit or stash them first — do NOT force-discard. The integration branch is `develop` unless overridden by `integration_branch` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`. Omitting this return step causes Protocol 90 Step 5.2 to fire a "wrong branch + clean" auto-correct on every subsequent item dispatch.

Key rules:

- Before writing or editing any repository file, verify you are on the intended
  workflow branch or inside the item worktree. If the checkout is on `develop`
  or `main`, create the feature/fix/refactor/hotfix branch or worktree before
  the first edit; do not start in the shared checkout and move changes later
- For substantial or multi-part mutating implementation work, commit
  immediately after each completed logical sub-part so interrupted runs have a
  recoverable checkpoint. Do not intentionally batch all completed sub-parts
  into one end-of-run commit, and never commit incomplete, failing, or
  incoherent edits only to satisfy this requirement
- For Full Pipeline: read spec + plan + runbook BEFORE writing any code
- For Refactor: read plan + runbook BEFORE writing any code (no spec)
- For Full Pipeline and Refactor work, read the plan's
  `Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check` before file edits. If applicable
  assumptions are recorded, re-read their authoritative sources and record
  `Still valid` in implementation-start notes before implementation, then cite
  that evidence in the Pre-Submission Self-Review Pass before handoff.
  If any source is changed, conflicting, or unverifiable, stop before mutation
  and return `Stale or conflicting` evidence to the parent orchestrator.
- For UI-facing work, discover design assets per
  `docs/workflow/development-workflow/design-assets.md` and use them as visual
  references; do not invent assets when none exist
- For Fast Track: require the Protocol 91 Fast Track blast-radius gate and
  Protocol 03 criteria to have passed before implementation; stop and report if
  scope expands, high call-site volume appears, or external-system impact is
  discovered after dispatch
- For Hotfix: branch from `main`, not `develop`
- For sweep, batch, helper-extraction, numeric-target, or pattern-completeness
  work, produce and verify residual evidence with `scope-residual-gate.sh`
  before `ready-for-human-review`; block or escalate instead of silently
  deferring residuals.
- Implementation files belong on implementation branches, not `spec/*` or
  `implementation-plan/*` branches. If a documentation-stage PR is in scope,
  Protocol 91 Step 8a must run `check-documentation-stage-alignment.sh`; correct
  or escalate any mismatch before `ready-for-human-review`.
- Never bypass build/lint/test verification
- Never force-push, force-with-lease, or otherwise rewrite a published workflow
  PR branch directly. Use follow-up commits; if a destructive branch update is
  unavoidable, stop before mutation and route the exact push through
  `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-branch-push-guard.sh`. In
  `workflow_hub`, resolve the helper from `WORKFLOW_TOOL_ROOT` and pass the
  pushed checkout as `--repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT"`.
- Always add or update a `changelog.d/` fragment before opening the PR (except spec/plan-only PRs; for fixes to unreleased work, update the existing fragment instead of adding a duplicate; in parallel batches, each PR keeps its own fragment); **hotfix exception**: `hotfix/*` PRs write a new versioned section (e.g., `[1.0.1] - YYYY-MM-DD`) directly below `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` (above all prior versioned sections) — hotfixes patch released code and are released immediately on merge; the backport PR carries the versioned entry to `develop` automatically
- Before staging a changelog fragment, run `bash scripts/development-workflow/changelog-fragments.sh validate`; for hotfix `CHANGELOG.md` edits, use the protocol's duplicate-section and link-reference checks.
- Changelog fragments and hotfix CHANGELOG entries must have no trailing whitespace and no trailing blank lines before commit; verify in-place after writing the release note and before staging (intentional two-space Markdown hard line breaks are exempt)
- Every modified `.md` file must end with a trailing newline (MD047) before staging; run the pre-staging check from the protocol's MD047 section on all modified markdown files before `git add`
- Before committing, if any `.sh` files are modified or newly created, run `shellcheck --severity=warning <files>` and `python3 scripts/lint/workflow-shell-guard-lint.py --base-ref origin/develop`, then fix all warnings before committing — ShellCheck violations will fail the CI `shellcheck.yml` check and cause unnecessary review-loop churn, and the workflow shell guard catches added-line patterns ShellCheck misses
- Workflow scripts must be bash 3.2 compatible (macOS ships bash 3.2 by default); do not use `local -A`, `declare -A`, or other bash 4+-only syntax — use parallel indexed arrays instead (e.g., `local -a keys; local -a vals`). ShellCheck does not warn on this by default when the shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- When creating or significantly modifying a `.sh` file, **or when adding or editing shell code blocks in a protocol or documentation `.md` file**, complete the **Shell Script Quality Checklist** in `03-implement-development-protocol.md` before opening the PR; it covers: (1) always use `--arg`/`--argjson` for jq variable injection — never expand shell vars in filter strings; (2) guard `set -o pipefail` scripts against SIGPIPE false-positives (exit 141) from `head`/`grep -m` — use `trap ... EXIT` (not PIPE; SIGPIPE goes to the child subprocess, not the parent shell) or `|| true`; (3) capture exit codes explicitly under `set -e` — `result=$(cmd)` aborts on non-zero just like a bare command; (4) use server-returned timestamps from API responses for event ordering — never local `date` output; (5) beware the `local` exit-code trap: `local VAR=$(cmd)` always sets `$?` to 0 because `local` itself exits 0, masking failures — declare with `local VAR` then assign `VAR=$(cmd)` on a separate line; (6) guard all `gh` / API calls against non-zero exits and empty output; (7) validate all positional parameters with `${VAR:?...}` at script entry before any network or filesystem operation; (8) for embedded shell snippets in protocol `.md` files: multi-command state-mutating blocks must start with `set -euo pipefail`; blocks that commit or push must include a wrong-branch guard; single-liner examples that can fail silently must add `|| exit 1`; (9) guard every `jq` call whose output feeds downstream logic with `-e` or an explicit exit-code handler (`|| { echo "ERROR"; exit 1; }`) and validate the parsed value is non-empty before use; (10) wrap external CLI calls subject to a timeout in `timeout <N> <cmd>` or an equivalent background-wait pattern with a deadline; check exit code 124 explicitly; never silently absorb a timeout; (11) validate that structured input (JSON, TSV, newline-delimited) is non-empty before parsing or iterating — empty input silently skips all iterations and can produce false-clean results; run `python3 scripts/lint/workflow-shell-guard-lint.py --base-ref origin/develop` for workflow shell changes because ShellCheck does not catch the added-line review-fix patterns
- Before opening any implementation PR, complete the **Pre-Submission Self-Review Pass** in `03-implement-development-protocol.md`: review `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD`, remove stale markers, verify sibling/caller consistency, confirm spec/plan or issue-body coverage, include the complex workflow decision-gate matrix or not-applicable rationale when Protocol 03 requires it, and add the self-review log to the draft PR description
- Before opening any implementation PR, verify the PR has a linked tracker item
  through the branch name, handoff metadata, or a closing/reference keyword in
  the PR body; if ad-hoc work has no item, create or accept a retroactive
  backlog item first and reference it in the PR description
- Do not stop at "PR opened"; continue through code review, automated review, and CI until the PR is ready or escalated
- When returning a standalone implementation completion handoff, rely on
  Protocol 91's Work Item Runner Summary path and include the
  `item-completion-self-check.sh` `Ground-Truth Completion Verification`
  section before claiming ready, blocked, escalated, or waiting-on-human state.
  When Step 7 was configured, pass `--require-review-summary true` and
  `--require-review-threads true` (helper defaults are false).
- Before writing any code for documentation or policy changes, grep for all existing references to the policy being changed across `docs/`, `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `REVIEW.md` — do not assume you know all locations; the grep is the discovery step. All matched files are candidates for the same update; explicitly confirm coverage of each before submitting. See Step 1b item 6 in `03-implement-development-protocol.md`
- When writing or editing protocol text that cites a script-emitted signal value (e.g., `REASON=`, `RESULT=`, `STATUS=`), read the relevant source script and verify the exact string before committing — do not cite it from memory or from other protocol text. Example: `grep -n 'REASON=' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh`. See Step 1b item 7 in `03-implement-development-protocol.md`
- When the PR is a documentation PR that describes script behavior (CLI output format, exit codes, option flags, API call patterns), complete the **Script-Accuracy Self-Check Checklist** in `03-implement-development-protocol.md` before opening the PR: enumerate every claim the documentation makes about the script, verify each claim with a targeted grep against the actual script source (not memory or reviewer assertions), resolve any discrepancies by updating the documentation to match the source, and append a self-check log to the PR description confirming each verified claim.
- When a PR adds a new filter parameter to a tool schema (Zod, JSON Schema, or equivalent), include a canary test for each new filter — two invocations (filter set vs. absent/different), assert results differ — before opening the PR; a missing canary test is a blocking code-review finding; see the Filter-Schema Canary Test Checklist in `03-implement-development-protocol.md`
- Before updating tracker status as part of a standalone implementation completion sequence, call `ensure_on_project_board <issue_number> "In Development"` (from `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`) to register the issue on the project board if it is not already present.
