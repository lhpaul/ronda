description: Run the automated reviewer loop (and CI loop) for a PR. Use when the user wants to run the reviewer loop on a specific PR or the current branch's PR until it is ready for human review or escalated.

Follow the standalone automated reviewer loop protocol:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`

## Repository Mode Context

Keep reviewer-loop routing thin. In `workflow_hub`, pass selected product
repository context through to shared reviewer and CI scripts for product
implementation PRs; hub-owned spec, plan, and workflow PRs continue to target
the hub. Do not duplicate product repository selection logic in this wrapper.

That document is the single source of truth. Key responsibilities:

- Determine target PR from user input (explicit number, "current" branch, or all open workflow PRs if requested)
- Step 7a runs **two sequential passes** for implementation PRs (Pass 1: Spec Compliance, then Pass 2: Code Quality) before converting to non-draft. Spec and plan PRs remain single-pass.
- Run Step 7 (`pr-review-loop.sh`) to completion, then Step 8 (`pr-ci-loop.sh`). Both run in the foreground of the same turn — see Protocol 91 Step 7/Step 8 for the mandatory "run in the foreground, never background-and-yield" rule; it applies here exactly as written there. Do not pass `--platform` unless intentionally overriding: the script reads `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` and uses `review.on_draft.github` plus `review.on_ready.github` when no `--platform` is given.
- Dispatch the matching fixer agent (spec-reviewer, implementation-plan-reviewer, or code-reviewer) when the platform reports needs_fixes, up to max_cycles
- When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`, pass the full Protocol 90 isolation assignment to any fixer handoff: resolved absolute worktree path, expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, mutation classification, and `isolation: "worktree"`.
- Apply `ready-for-human-review` / `needs-fixes` per 92-pr-readiness-signal-protocol.md. For `spec/*` and `implementation-plan/*` PRs, route through Protocol 91 Step 8a so `check-documentation-stage-alignment.sh` runs before `ready-for-human-review`.
- Track all blocking findings across cycles in an issue ledger. After each fixer push, post a fix commit comment listing resolved issues. When the loop terminates, post a final summary table on the PR using `gh pr comment`. Run `scripts/development-workflow/pr-ownership-guard.sh --pr <pr_number> --expected-branch <branch_name>` before each such comment and stop on a non-zero exit (issue #1444).
- When a review-thread reply cites a workflow specification line as support,
  attach the conformance declaration (`Conforms` / `Departs` / `Not yet
  implemented`, or a plain undetermined statement) required by
  `docs/workflow/development-workflow/architecture-decision-escalation.md`.
  Where a finding would lead to a full `architecture_decision` escalation,
  point to Protocol 91 and that canonical page rather than a lighter
  requirement.
- Use the helper scripts in `scripts/development-workflow/`
- For `spec/*` and `implementation-plan/*` PRs, apply Protocol 93's matrix
  coherence re-audit rule: when two consecutive cycles' blocking findings
  implicate the same stateful contract (decision matrix, state table,
  lifecycle, precedence rules, or — for Refactor items — the work item brief),
  re-run the six-check audit before the next fix push and record the result in
  the fix commit comment's `Matrix coherence re-audit:` line. Stuck-loop
  escalation rules always evaluate first and win; the re-audit never extends a
  cycle cap.
