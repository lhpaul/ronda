# Cursor Command: Run Item

`/run-item` is the **canonical single-item bounded command**. It runs the shared
bounded prelude before any mutation, then advances exactly one non-epic item
through Protocol 91 until a real terminal condition.

In Cursor, `/run-item <target>` is the normal user-facing entrypoint. After the
bounded prelude has been printed and explicit flags or human acceptance confirm
the selected scope and policy, Cursor may hand off internally to the configured
`item-orchestrator` subagent and then to stage-specific subagents. That internal
handoff preserves the confirmed item, base branch, guardrails, selected policy,
and checkpoint state; the receiving context must not rerun the bounded prelude
or re-prompt for the same confirmed policy. If Cursor cannot perform that
handoff in the current environment, continue from `/run-item` in the current
context and preserve all Protocol 91 stops.

For portfolio-wide or ambiguous targets, use `/run-work` (portfolio scan) or
`/run-epic` (bounded epic). `/run-item-work` is a deprecated compatibility alias
with identical behavior.

## Bounded prelude and Protocol 91

Run the shared bounded prelude and single-item loop per
`docs/workflow/development-workflow/bounded-run-prelude.md` and Protocol 91
(`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`).
The prelude command flags mirror this command's scope flags (`--target`, `--issue`,
`--branch`, `--pr`, `--development`, policy overrides, `--json`).

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`

Key responsibilities:

- Print `policyRecommendation.confirmationSummary` before mutation, including
  effective policy, field sources, pending checkpoint guidance, copy-paste
  equivalent, and the read-only guarantee.
- After explicit autonomy flags or human acceptance, record the
  invocation-scoped `RUN_ITEM_POLICY_CONFIRMED` item/policy binding and do not
  re-prompt for the same selected policy.
- Pending checkpoints, guardrail stops, review/CI failures, risk violations, and
  missing permissions still stop the run.
- When resuming after a human-checkpoint pause from a prior worktree-isolated
  run, invoke Protocol 91's fail-closed checkpoint-resume gate before any
  mutation with item, expected branch, expected worktree, main repo root, and
  checkpoint state. Continue only on `RESULT=continue`; pending checkpoints and
  unclear isolation stop. The gate never satisfies or waives checkpoint state,
  and main-clone resumes must not change directories.
- Resolve the request to exactly one non-epic workflow item
- Use helper scripts in `scripts/development-workflow/` for next-action classification
- After candidate discovery and the nested-artifact guard, require a
  `compatible` result from `validate-branch-reuse.sh` before reusing an existing
  branch. Stop distinctly on incompatible or unverifiable evidence; never
  delete or rewrite the branch automatically, and keep tracking divergence
  diagnostic only.
- In `workflow_hub`, state selected product repository, artifact owner, and mutation target before implementation mutation
- Continue through creator, reviewer, PR, automated review, and CI until terminal
- If delegated merge authority is active and the merge gate returns
  `merge_allowed`, continue through merge, branch cleanup,
  `post-merge-cleanup.sh`, and live tracker verification before reporting
  terminal
- If the merge gate returns `exceptional_bypass_authorized`, follow the
  canonical exceptional-bypass policy in
  `docs/workflow/development-workflow/guardrails-enforcement.md` Gate 5;
  delegated merge authority is not enough
- Treat merge authority explicitly: `merge_granted` means readiness is
  intermediate and the runner continues through merge; `merge_denied` means the
  ready PR stops as `ready_human_merge` and no merge command is run. Stopping
  at readiness without a named blocker in a merge-granted run is
  `policy_inconsistent`
- If the target is epic-like, stop and use `/run-epic` instead
