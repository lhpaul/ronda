description: In Development stage. Implements a feature via Full Pipeline (with spec+plan), Refactor (plan only, no spec), Fast Track (bug/simple change), or Hotfix (critical production bug), then keeps the PR moving until reviewer and CI readiness are resolved. Usage: /implement-development [dev folder path | brief description of fix | "hotfix: [description]"]
---

Follow the implementation protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md`

### Which path?

- **Full Pipeline**: provide the dev folder path (e.g., `docs/specs/developments/20250101_my-feature/`)
- **Refactor**: provide the dev folder path (plan-only folder, no spec)
- **Fast Track**: provide a brief description of the bug or simple change
- **Hotfix**: prefix with "hotfix:" (e.g., "hotfix: users can't log in after password reset")

Key rules:

- Full Pipeline: read spec + plan + runbook BEFORE writing any code
- Refactor: read plan + runbook BEFORE writing any code (no spec)
- Fast Track: require the Protocol 91 Fast Track blast-radius gate and Protocol
  03 criteria to have passed before implementation; stop and report if scope
  expands, high call-site volume appears, or external-system impact is
  discovered after dispatch
- Hotfix: branch from `main`, not `develop`
- In `workflow_hub`, state selected product repository, local path or remote identity, and mutation target before file edits, branch creation, commits, or implementation PR creation; stop when context is missing or ambiguous
- Always add or update a `changelog.d/` fragment before opening the PR (except spec/plan-only PRs; for fixes to unreleased work, update the existing fragment instead of adding a duplicate; in parallel batches, each PR keeps its own fragment)
- Do not stop at "PR opened"; continue through code review, automated review, and CI until the PR is ready or escalated
