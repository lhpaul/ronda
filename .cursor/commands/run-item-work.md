# Cursor Command: Run Item Work (deprecated)

> **Deprecated**: `/run-item-work` is a compatibility alias for **`/run-item`**.
> New invocations should use `/run-item <target>`.

Behavior is identical to `/run-item`:

- `.cursor/commands/run-item.md`
- `docs/workflow/development-workflow/bounded-run-prelude.md`
- `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`

This alias bypasses `/run-work` routing and advances exactly one known item
directly. For portfolio scans or epic batches, use `/run-work` or `/run-epic`.

The alias inherits `/run-item` preflight confirmation behavior, including
`policyRecommendation.confirmationSummary` and the invocation-scoped
`RUN_ITEM_POLICY_CONFIRMED` item/policy binding.

It also inherits `/run-item` checkpoint-resume gate behavior: a checkpointed
worktree-isolated run must invoke the fail-closed gate with complete context
before mutation. A main-clone resume stops instead of re-entering the worktree,
and isolation verification does not satisfy or waive checkpoint state.
