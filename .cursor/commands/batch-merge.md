description: >
  Merge all ready PRs in a parallel batch into the target base branch sequentially, auto-resolving trivial
  CHANGELOG and documentation conflicts, pausing for human input only on non-trivial conflicts,
  and running post-merge-cleanup for each successfully merged PR. Prints the merge plan for
  visibility but proceeds immediately without requiring confirmation.
  Usage: /batch-merge [#PR1 #PR2 ...] or /batch-merge --prs 101,102,103

Follow `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/94-batch-merge-protocol.md` exactly.

**Auto-discovery** (no arguments): discovers all PRs labeled `ready-for-human-review` targeting the configured base branch.

**Explicit PR list**: pass PR numbers as arguments, e.g. `/batch-merge #101 #102 #103` or `/batch-merge --prs 101,102,103`. The command proceeds to per-PR readiness checks regardless of label status.

Key rules:

- Print the merge plan (Step 3 of the protocol) for visibility, then proceed immediately without waiting for user confirmation.
- For each PR, run `./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh merge --pr <number> --expected-head-sha <reviewed-headRefOid>`.
- Auto-resolve CHANGELOG and non-overlapping documentation conflicts; pause and escalate non-trivial conflicts.
- After each successful merge, follow Protocol 94 Step 4.2 for verification, guarded branch deletion, local branch preparation, cleanup, and post-recheck admission before selecting another PR.
- Never leave the target base branch in a conflicted state.
- Always print the final summary table (Step 5) regardless of outcome.
