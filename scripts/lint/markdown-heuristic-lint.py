"""
Markdown heuristic lint checks for spec, plan, and CHANGELOG documents.

Two checks are implemented:

  GLOB001 — Suspicious non-recursive glob
      Detects a non-recursive glob pattern (e.g., *.sh) inside a fenced code
      block when the surrounding document prose (within a configurable window)
      uses recursive-language cues (e.g., "subdirectories", "recursively").

  COUNT001 — Within-document count disagreement
      Detects a narrative count phrase (e.g., "4 acceptance criteria") that
      disagrees with the count of list items in the section immediately
      following (within 30 lines).

Both checks support inline suppression via:
    <!-- markdown-heuristic-disable GLOB001 -->
    <!-- markdown-heuristic-disable COUNT001 -->
placed on the same line or the line immediately preceding the finding.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/lint/markdown-heuristic-lint.py <file> [<file> ...]

Exit codes:
    0 — no violations found
    1 — one or more violations found
