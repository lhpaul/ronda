def diff_shape(diff: str) -> str:
    """Classify what `diff` actually is, before trying to parse it.

    A path list, a file listing, or any other non-diff text parses as a diff
    with no hunks and yields an empty changed map, which reads exactly like a
    clean run (issue #1658, observed on PR #1646 where a real WS002 survived an
    `--input <path list>` invocation that exited 0).

    The markers are matched against the syntax this parser consumes, not against
    a prefix: a stray `@@ some prose` line or a Markdown `---` rule is not a
    diff. The classification then turns on whether the input carries changed
    lines this parser is failing to read, which is the only case worth refusing:

    * A hunk header means there ARE changed lines. Without a `+++` target header
      they cannot be attributed to a path, so the input is unreadable — a
      `git diff --no-prefix` output, for instance.
    * A `+++` target header with no hunk is a fragment either way: in real
      output a target header exists precisely to introduce a hunk, so a path
      with no lines behind it is malformed even when a `diff --git` line frames
      it. This case is checked before the metadata-only one.
    * No hunk header, no target header, and a `diff --git` line means a genuine
      Git record with no textual changes at all: a mode-only change, a binary
      file, a pure rename. There is nothing to attribute, so zero examined is
      the correct answer and the run passes. Refusing these would fail CI on any
      pull request that contains one.

    The check is **per record**, not global. A diff with several file records
    would otherwise pass on the strength of one well-formed record while another
    carried a hunk this parser cannot attribute: the markers would all be
    present *somewhere*, and changed_lines() would credit the unreadable
    record's lines to the previous record's path.
