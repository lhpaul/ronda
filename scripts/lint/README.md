# scripts/lint

Lint helpers for spec, plan, and CHANGELOG markdown documents, plus static
checks over the workflow shell scripts themselves.

## markdown-heuristic-lint.py

Custom Python 3 heuristic checks that complement `markdownlint-cli2`.

**Checks implemented:**

- **GLOB001** — Suspicious non-recursive glob: detects a non-recursive glob
  pattern (e.g., `*.sh`) inside a fenced code block when surrounding prose uses
  recursive-language cues (e.g., "subdirectories", "recursively"). The cue list
  is declared as `RECURSIVE_CUES` at the top of the script and can be extended
  without changing the detection logic.

- **COUNT001** — Within-document count disagreement: detects a narrative count
  phrase (e.g., "4 acceptance criteria", "three steps") that disagrees with the
  number of list items in the immediately following section (within 30 lines).

Both checks support inline suppression:

```markdown
<!-- markdown-heuristic-disable GLOB001 -->
<!-- markdown-heuristic-disable COUNT001 -->
```

Place the directive on the same line as the finding or on the immediately
preceding line. Suppressions must include a reviewer-visible rationale comment
nearby so the PR diff explains why the rule was suppressed.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 scripts/lint/markdown-heuristic-lint.py <file> [<file> ...]
```

Exit code `0` means no findings; exit code `1` means one or more findings.

**Local run (all target files):**

```bash
find docs/specs/developments docs/testing/workflow -name "*.md" -print0 \
  | xargs -0 python3 scripts/lint/markdown-heuristic-lint.py CHANGELOG.md
```

## workflow-shell-guard-lint.py

Diff-based guard for newly added lines in `scripts/development-workflow/**/*.sh`.

**Checks implemented:**

- **SH001** - Critical command failure suppression: detects added lines that run
  `gh`, `git`, `curl`, or `haystack` and suppress failures with `|| true`.
- **SH002** - Command substitution masking in `local` / `declare` / `export`:
  flags shell assignments that can hide a failed command substitution.
- **SH003** - Unguarded `jq -r` assignment: flags control-flow assignments that
  read from `jq -r` without `-e` or an explicit exit-code guard.
- **SH004** - Unanchored branch-prefix grep: flags workflow grep checks that
  can match substrings such as `hotfix/` instead of a true branch prefix.
- **SH005** - Bash 4 associative arrays: flags `local -A` and `declare -A` in
  workflow scripts because the repo supports macOS bash 3.2.

Use explicit control flow instead of blanket suppression. If a best-effort
failure is intentional, keep the suppression local and add a rationale:

```bash
git fetch origin "$base" 2>/dev/null || true # workflow-shell-guard: allow SH001 - best effort cache refresh
```

Rule-specific suppressions use the same shape:

```bash
RESULT=$(jq -r '.state' <<< "$payload") # workflow-shell-guard: allow SH003 - caller checks the exit code elsewhere
```

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 scripts/lint/workflow-shell-guard-lint.py --base-ref origin/develop
```

## workflow-shell-snippet-lint.py

Diff-based guard for executable fenced shell snippets on framework-owned
guidance surfaces. Put one adjacent marker before each changed executable
fence:

```text
<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->
<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```

`bash` snippets visibly launch Bash (and remain Bash 3.2 compatible).
`bash-zsh` snippets must avoid implicit word splitting, `set -- $value`, and
Bash-only syntax. The linter reports WS001 through WS006 for missing contracts
or unsafe boundaries.

```bash
python3 scripts/lint/workflow-shell-snippet-lint.py --base-ref origin/develop
bash scripts/lint/tests/test-workflow-shell-snippet-lint.sh
```

**Exit 0 without an examined count is not evidence.** Every run prints a
summary line — `examined=N files, M fences, K changed-lines (source: ...);
findings=N` — precisely so a silent success cannot be mistaken for a real pass.
If `examined=0`, no WS rule ran and the run proves nothing about WS001–WS006.

The summary is printed before **every** exit, refusals included.

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | The run examined its scope and found nothing. `examined=0 files` here means the diff was well formed but touched no in-scope guidance file — a legitimate "nothing to check", announced on stderr. |
| `1` | Findings were reported. |
| `2` | The run examined nothing and refuses to be read as a pass. |

The four ways a run can examine nothing are reported distinctly, because they
are different failures:

| Condition | Message |
| --- | --- |
| `git diff` failed | `ERROR: <git stderr>` |
| Input carries no `diff --git` line, no well-formed hunk header, and no `+++` target header (a path list, prose, a stray `@@` line) | `expects a unified diff` |
| Changed lines the parser cannot attribute — a hunk with no `+++ b/<path>` header (a `--no-prefix` diff), or a `+++` header with no hunk behind it | `carries changed lines this parser cannot read` |
| The diff is empty | `the diff under examination is empty` |

`--input` / `--diff-file` takes a **unified diff**, not a path list. A path list
was previously parsed as an empty diff and exited 0 while a real WS002 was still
present (PR #1646); it is now an error. Produce the diff with
`git diff --unified=0 <base>...HEAD` and keep the default `a/` and `b/`
prefixes, or use `--base-ref` and let the script run `git diff` itself.

What separates a legitimate zero from an unreadable input is whether the diff
carries changed lines at all. A **hunk header** means it does: without a
`+++ b/<path>` target header those lines cannot be attributed to a path, so the
input is refused. A record with **no hunk and no `+++` header** but a `diff --git`
line is a genuine Git change with no textual content — a mode-only change, a
binary file, a pure rename — so zero examined is the right answer and the run
passes, provided it carries the metadata git emits for one (`old mode`,
`new file mode`, `index`, `similarity index`, `rename from`, `Binary files ...
differ`, `GIT binary patch`). A bare `diff --git a b` line with nothing behind
it is text shaped like a header, not a record. A `+++` header with no hunk
behind it is a fragment either way: in real output a target header exists
precisely to introduce a hunk.

Every record is checked separately, and the text before the first `diff --git`
header counts as one: validation covers exactly the bytes the parser reads, so a
well-formed record cannot vouch for an unreadable neighbour. A deletion,
whose target header is `+++ /dev/null`, is likewise a valid diff with a
legitimate zero.

`--base-ref` diffs **committed** history (`<base>...HEAD`), so uncommitted work
is invisible to it: run it after committing, or the empty-diff refusal will
tell you so. Pass `--allow-empty` only where an empty diff is genuinely
expected. `--all` reads no diff and is exempt from the refusal.

**Tests:**

```bash
bash scripts/lint/tests/test-workflow-shell-guard-lint.sh
```

## lint-graphql-query-literals.py

Repo-wide static check for every `gh api graphql` query literal (`query='...'`,
including one built via adjacent bash-quote concatenation such as
`'...'"$var"'...'`) under a `scripts/` tree.

**Why**: #1828 shipped a `gh api graphql` query in `apply-readiness-labels.sh`
with one extra closing brace. The suite mocks `gh`, so a syntactically invalid
query text stayed green until it hit GitHub live, escalating
`codex-occupancy-timeline-fetch-failed` on every `codex-github` PR. This lint
generalizes the tokenizer that fix proved (originally scoped to one file's test
in `test-apply-readiness-labels.sh`) into a standalone, repo-wide check so the
next unbalanced or misnested literal is caught in CI before merge, regardless
of which script it lands in.

**What it checks**: braces (`{}`), parens (`()`), and brackets (`[]`) nest
correctly — order, not just totals (`query{a}}{` has equal counts but is not
valid). Delimiters inside GraphQL string values (`"..."`, `"""..."""`, both
with backslash escapes) and `#` comments are ignored, since they are data or
prose, not syntax.

**Scope**: files under any `tests/` directory are excluded — this checker's own
test fixtures deliberately construct malformed and regex-shaped `query='...'`
text to prove the tokenizer, and those are not production `gh api graphql`
calls.

**What counts as a GraphQL query literal** (all must hold):

- The file mentions `graphql` at all.
- `query='` begins a shell word: a flag argument (`-f query='`) or an
  assignment to a variable whose name ends in `query` (`graphql_query='`,
  `local _gql_items_query='`). `obj.query='` or a mid-word match is ignored.
  `gh api graphql` need not appear on the same command, because real call sites
  use wrappers (`gh "${gh_args[@]}"`, `workflow_run_gh_capture_stderr api
  graphql`) or pass the variable to a helper.
- The literal opens (after whitespace and `#` comments) with `query`,
  `mutation`, `subscription`, `fragment`, or an anonymous `{` selection set, so
  shell prose that happens to contain `query='` is ignored.
- The match sits in executed shell code. A small shell-context lexer treats
  double-quoted strings, `#` comments (whole-line or trailing), other
  single-quoted and `$'...'` strings, and heredoc bodies as data, so
  `echo "gh api graphql -f query='...'"` or `cmd # query='...'` is ignored. A
  command substitution (`$( )` or legacy backticks) is code again even inside
  double quotes, so the common real shape `var="$(gh api graphql -f query='...')"`
  is still checked. Arithmetic `$(( ))` / `(( ))` is skipped so a left shift is
  never read as a heredoc, and any valid heredoc delimiter is recognised.

**Known limitations** (false-negative surfaces, not defects):

- A query fragment held in a separate variable (e.g.
  `pr_fields='commits(last:1){...}'` spliced into a larger query by
  concatenation) is treated as an opaque, assumed-balanced blob at the splice
  point rather than independently validated. Renaming it does not help (a
  fragment does not open with an operation keyword). Inline the fragment into
  the query literal to bring it into scope; otherwise it is covered only by the
  live-validation requirement below.
- Only single-quoted `query='...'` literals are linted for balance. A
  double-quoted `query="..."` value that opens as GraphQL is **rejected** as a
  finding (bash would expand GraphQL `$variables` inside it), while a plain
  reference such as `query="$graphql_query"` is left alone. Heredoc-built
  queries are not scanned; keep new queries in the single-quoted form.
- An unquoted expansion between segments (`'a'$x'b'`) ends the join, so the
  head segment alone is checked. Quote the expansion (`'a'"$x"'b'`).

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 scripts/lint/lint-graphql-query-literals.py [<path> ...]  # default: scripts
bash scripts/lint/tests/test-lint-graphql-query-literals.sh
```

Exit code `0` means no findings; exit code `1` means one or more unbalanced or
misnested query literals were found; exit code `2` means a given path does not
exist or the run examined no shell file at all. The `tests/` exclusion is
evaluated relative to each scan root, and an explicitly named file is always
scanned. Every run prints an `examined=<files>, queries=<count>, findings=<count>`
summary line to stderr so a clean run can be told apart from a run that
silently matched nothing.

**Live-validate new or changed queries**: this lint proves delimiter *syntax*
is well-formed; it cannot prove the query is accepted by the GitHub GraphQL
schema (unknown fields, wrong argument types, etc. all pass a delimiter check).
Any PR that adds or changes a `gh api graphql` query literal under `scripts/`
must run that query live against a real GitHub repository/PR once (e.g. by
exercising the calling script's normal path, or invoking the query directly
with `gh api graphql -f query='...' -f ...`) before the PR is trusted on a
green mocked suite alone. See
[`docs/best-practices/3-testing.md`](../../docs/best-practices/3-testing.md#live-validate-new-or-changed-graphql-queries).
