Usage:
  add-backlog-item.sh resolve
  add-backlog-item.sh create --title <title> (--body <text> | --body-file <path>) [--label <name>] ... [--type <value>] [--priority <value>] [--size <value>]

resolve
  Prints machine-readable lines:
    ISSUE_TRACKER_PROVIDER=<raw or empty>
    DESTINATION_KIND=github|linear|other|none
    CREATE_VIA=<hint for agents>

create
  When DESTINATION_KIND is github, creates one GitHub issue via gh (requires gh auth).
  For linear, other, or none, exits non-zero with guidance (agents follow 00-add-backlog-item-protocol.md).

  --priority <value>  Optional. Set the project Priority field. The value is
                      resolved against the project's actual Priority field
                      options (see docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/github-projects.md);
                      typical boards use Urgent, High, Medium, Low.
                      When given explicitly, it is validated BEFORE the issue
                      is created; a value that cannot be resolved against the
                      board's Priority options is a hard error (exit 1) and no
                      issue is created.
                      When omitted, the default adapts to the configured
                      board: "Medium" if present, else "Normal" (for boards
                      still set up per the framework's pre-#1501 docs), else
                      left unset — never a hard error for the default case.
  --size <value>      Optional. Set the project Size field. Valid values: XS, S, M, L, XL.
                      When omitted, the Size field is left unset.
  --type <value>      Optional. Set the project classification field. Valid values: Feature, Bug,
                      Refactor, Workflow. When omitted, the Type field is left unset.
                      In a framework-mode repository (template.is_template: true in
                      .ai-dev-workflow.yaml), --type Workflow is refused before
                      creation (exit 1) — framework-mode repositories classify their
                      own workflow/process/tooling items as Feature, Bug, or Refactor
                      instead. This refusal is exact and case-sensitive; it applies to
                      the GitHub destination and the Linear create handoff alike, and
                      no flag or environment variable bypasses it.

Exit codes (create, GitHub destination):
  0  Success (including a resolved-value tracker-field skip when the tracker
     provider/project genuinely does not apply).
  1  A value passed to --priority could not be resolved against the board's
     actual Priority options (no issue was created), OR --type Workflow was
     requested in a framework-mode repository (refused before creation; no
     issue was created — see --type above).
  5  Partial success: the issue WAS created (see the printed URL) but one or
     more required post-creation project field updates did not land — either
     the write itself failed, or a post-write verification read found the
     board does not actually show the requested value (Status is always
     verified against "Backlog"; Type/Priority/Size are verified only when
     requested). Do not retry issue creation; retry only the affected
     field(s), or set them manually. Every requested field update is
     attempted independently and is not skipped by another field's failure.
