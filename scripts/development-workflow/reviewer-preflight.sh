# reviewer-preflight.sh — cross-check reviewer configuration before dispatch.
#
# Issue #1561: before Protocol 91 dispatches an item, this script cross-checks
# the shared workflow reviewer configuration, the machine-local override, and
# each reviewer platform's own configuration, and reports a disagreement
# rather than letting the run proceed on an assumption. See
# docs/specs/developments/20260911230501_1561-reviewer-preflight/ for the
# spec and implementation plan.
#
# Read-only: this script runs only git show / git ls-remote / git cat-file /
# git rev-parse / git merge-base / git status --porcelain, gh pr view, and
# python3 reads of temporary copies. It never checks out, commits, pushes,
# opens a pull request, comments, labels, or writes any tracked file under
# --repo-root — and, as of #1561's round-26 fix, it never writes anything
# inside .git/ either: `git ls-remote` (unlike the `git fetch` this script
# used to run for the same "refreshed from the remote before reading" rule)
# only queries the remote and never creates or updates refs/remotes/*,
# FETCH_HEAD, or the object database. A remote tip resolved this way is read
# directly by its SHA (`git show <sha>:<path>`), not through a local
# remote-tracking ref this script would otherwise have to create. When that
# SHA's commit object is not already present in the local object database
# (this script never fetches, so nothing guarantees it is), reading it is
# impossible without a fetch this script will not perform: that surfaces as
# read_ref_file's own existing rc=2 (ref-invalid-or-read-failed) contract —
# the same path an unresolvable ref already took before this change — which
# each caller already resolves to a documented outcome consistent with the
# spec's outcome matrix: the shared-config caller fails closed (a tooling
# failure, since dispatch cannot proceed without a shared reviewer list to
# cross-check against), and the per-platform (coderabbit) caller degrades
# that one platform to Undetermined/check-inconclusive rather than blocking
# every platform on one unreadable object. The one case read_ref_file's own
# git-show/rev-parse-verify combination cannot disambiguate on its own is
# branch-resume's ancestry SELECTION between a local and a remote copy
# (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` needs both commit objects present to
# answer "is X an ancestor of Y" at all, not merely to read file content at
# one of them) — that path adds its own explicit `git cat-file -e` presence
# check before attempting the ancestry comparison and fails closed (tooling
# failure) rather than fetching when the remote object is not present.
set -euo pipefail

# In a partial clone (a supported Git checkout mode), reading an object this
# script does not already have locally can transparently trigger a lazy
# fetch from the promisor remote — confirmed live with GIT_TRACE=1: `git
# show <sha>:<path>` on a SHA resolved via ls-remote but not locally present
# ran an internal `git fetch origin --filter=blob:none`, writing new packs
# under .git while the AC-2 porcelain snapshots (which only cover the
# working tree and refs, not the object store's own pack files) stayed
# unchanged and so never detected it. This makes every child git process
# this script starts treat a missing object as a hard failure instead of
# lazily fetching it — the same "cannot read without fetching" outcome this
# script already documents and handles (read_ref_file's rc=2, the
# branch-resume ancestry cat-file presence check) for the non-partial-clone
# case, now enforced for partial clones too rather than silently fetching
# around it.

# This 1-second floor extends the effective deadline itself by exactly one

# T-7-shaped case (one platform read genuinely times out, and two or more
# fast in-memory steps still need to run afterward) into an outright
