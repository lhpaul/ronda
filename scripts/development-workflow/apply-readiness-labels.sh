# Helper-gated readiness labels (issue #1408).
#
# Readiness labels (`ready-for-human-review`, `ready-for-regression`) are input
# to the merge gates (`run-epic-delegated-gate.sh`, `batch-merge.sh`,
# `workflow-next-action.sh`), not cosmetics. Delegated runners have applied them
# by hand before the ready-phase reviewer finished, asserting readiness no
# reviewer verdict supports (PR #2097 on a downstream repo; PR #77 on another).
# This script is the only sanctioned way to apply them: it refuses unless every
# configured ready-phase reviewer check run is `completed` for the *current* head
# SHA, the reviewer posted no blocking findings on that SHA, and no
# non-reviewer check is still pending or failing.
#
# An absent reviewer check run is treated as NOT clean — Cursor "Restrict
# Access" can make Bugbot refuse to run, and "no check run" must never read as
# "reviewer clean". The same applies to a `neutral` check run that accompanies a
# Bugbot usage/spend-limit notice: the reviewer never actually reviewed.
#
# The reviewer leg applies to implementation branches only (`feature/*`,
# `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `backport/hotfix/*`) — the same boundary Protocol 91
# draws for `IS_IMPLEMENTATION_PR` and for its Step 7b label derivation table.
# Ready-phase reviewers are not dispatched on `spec/*`,
# `implementation-plan/*`, graduation (`develop-<slug>`), `release/*`, or
# `hotfix/*` PRs, so no check run can exist for them; gating on one would
# refuse every doc-stage, release, and hotfix PR. `hotfix/*` is exempt the
# same way `release/*` is because pr-review-loop.sh's `_check_release_pr_guard`
# skips the reviewer loop for `release/*` AND `hotfix/*` head branches — no
# reviewer check is ever dispatched on a hotfix, so requiring one would
# permanently refuse both readiness labels `reviewer-check-absent`. Hotfix PRs
# still get what release PRs get: the CI leg applies unchanged (PR #1818
# finding 1, round 7). The CI leg still applies on those branches.
#
# `ready-for-regression` blocks on failing non-reviewer checks but permits
# pending ones: that label is what *starts* the configured regression workflow,
# so requiring green CI before it is applied would make Step 7b depend on checks
# the label itself triggers. `ready-for-human-review` — the merge-gate input —
# blocks on pending as well.
#
# Findings are read from `pulls/N/comments` (inline review comments) and
# `pulls/N/reviews`, never from issue comments: Bugbot reports through a
# `COMMENTED` PR review with inline comments, the same surface
# `run_bugbot_review()` in pr-review-loop.sh reads.
#
# Issue comments are read for exactly one purpose: when a reviewer check run
# finishes `neutral`, `cancelled`, or `skipped`, Bugbot's own usage/spend-limit
# and restricted-access notices arrive as a `cursor[bot]` issue comment for that
# head. A bare `neutral` therefore reads as clean only when no such notice
# exists — otherwise the verdict is `refused` / `reviewer-unavailable`. Same
# rule as `run_bugbot_review()` (pr-review-loop.sh ~3838).

  cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: apply-readiness-labels.sh --pr <number> [--repo <owner/repo>] \
  --label <ready-for-human-review|ready-for-regression> \
  [--branch <branch>] [--dry-run] [--json]

Refuses to apply the label unless every configured ready-phase reviewer check
run is `completed` for the current head SHA, the reviewer posted no blocking
findings on that SHA, and no other check is pending or failing. A `neutral`
reviewer check run with a Bugbot usage/spend-limit notice is refused as well:
the reviewer never reviewed.

Before reading any further PR state, an ownership guard (issue #1837, the
same pr-ownership-guard.sh helper pr-review-loop.sh's --branch guard (#1444)
calls) verifies the PR's head branch belongs to --branch (or, when omitted,
the branch currently checked out in this repo root). This addresses a PR by
number only; under parallel waves a wrong --pr would otherwise label a
sibling's PR. A mismatch refuses `ownership-mismatch`; an unresolvable
check (gh/jq failure, no --branch and a detached/non-workflow checkout)
escalates `ownership-unverified` — never a silent pass.

--dry-run prints the decision (RESULT/REASON and every other verdict field)
and applies nothing: no label add, no stale-label removal, no `needs-fixes`
annotation. RESULT is `would-label` in place of `labeled` when the gate
would otherwise pass; `refused` and `escalate` verdicts are unchanged
(neither mutates a passing PR) but DRY_RUN=true shows no removal ran even
when the PR already carried the label.

Ownership x dry-run outcome table (every combination the ownership guard and
--dry-run introduce; the pre-existing reviewer/CI gate rows below are
unchanged by either):
  owned      + not dry-run -> labeled/refused/escalate (existing gate), mutates as before
  owned      + --dry-run   -> would-label/refused/escalate (existing gate), never mutates
  not_owned  + either      -> refused, REASON=ownership-mismatch, never mutates
                              (branch mismatch OR cross-repository PR with the
                              same branch name); re-resolve the PR number, do
                              not redispatch a reviewer/CI fix
  unresolved + either      -> escalate, REASON=ownership-unverified, never
                              mutates (gh/jq failure, or no --branch on a
                              non-workflow checkout); fix gh/jq or pass --branch

Prints RESULT=<labeled|would-label|refused|escalate> and REASON=<slug>.
Exit codes: 0 labeled, 1 refused, 2 escalate (state could not be read).
Refusal reasons: reviewer-check-absent, reviewer-check-not-completed,
reviewer-unavailable, reviewer-check-name-unresolved,
reviewer-evidence-unreadable,
reviewer-check-unknown-conclusion, reviewer-policy-empty, blocking-findings,
reviewer-state-changed, ci-pending, ci-failing, head-changed-before-apply,
ownership-mismatch.
Escalation reasons:
head-revalidate-failed, head-changed-after-apply, ready-config-unreadable,
base-config-unreadable, revalidation-unreadable, ownership-unverified.
The ready-phase reviewer list is read from the PR head's own
.ai-dev-workflow.yaml; an unreadable head configuration escalates (fail-closed)
rather than falling back to this checkout's configuration. The required
reviewer set is the BASE branch policy — the loop dispatches ready-phase
platforms from the base configuration, so head-only additions are never
required, but a head cannot waive a base-configured reviewer. The base policy
is resolved with local review overrides applied (the same effective policy
the loop dispatches); an absent .ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml falls back to the
shared policy. hotfix/* branches are exempt from the reviewer leg exactly as
release/* branches are — the reviewer loop is never dispatched on them — but
the CI leg still applies.

# comment_only_reviewer_verdict <platform> <bot_login> — the verdict path for
# ready-phase reviewers that publish NO check run (codex-github, coderabbit,
# claude-code-action, copilot, devin, greptile — every documented platform
# besides haystack/bugbot/ronda). Rounds 11-13 routed every readiness-label
# producer through this helper, so refusing those platforms
# `reviewer-check-name-unresolved` was a permanent deadlock: a repository
# configured with codex-github (this PR's own ready-phase reviewer) could
# never reach either readiness label even though pr-review-loop.sh fully
# supports the platform (PR #1818 thread PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m1Dec, round 14).
#
# Evidence semantics mirror the loop's comment-only readers
# (run_codex_github_review / run_devin_review / run_coderabbit_review): the
# "reviewer ran and was clean" verdict is the latest PR review the platform
# bot submitted against the CURRENT head SHA. Fail closed — no bot review on
# the head refuses `reviewer-check-absent`, never a silent pass. Findings are
# then counted by the shared count_reviewer_blocking_findings, time-bounded
# to that review's submitted_at (the comment-only analogue of the check run's
# started_at). Sets reviewer_started_at and scan_blocking_count; refuses or
# escalates directly on failure.
#
# Round 15 (PR #1818 thread PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m1pF_): when no review exists,
# platform completion adapters run first — codex-github publishes its clean
# result as a SHA-pinned root PR comment (issue comment) and Greptile
# completes by reacting to its trigger comment, so a `pulls/N/reviews`-only
# read stayed `reviewer-check-absent` forever even after the loop returned
# clean. The adapters accept exactly the evidence surfaces those loop
# implementations accept (see comment_only_completion_evidence below); fail
# closed still applies when none is present.
#
# Round 15 (PR #1818 thread PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m1pGF): the inline-comment scan
# bound is the EARLIEST of the review's submitted_at and the earliest
# created_at of that review's OWN inline comments (matched by
# pull_request_review_id) — inline comments created while the review was
# pending have created_at < submitted_at, so a submitted_at-only bound
# excluded the review's own findings. The review-body scan keeps the
# submitted_at bound, and inline comments from PREVIOUS reviews carry the

# comment_only_completion_evidence <platform> <bot_login> — round 15 (PR
# #1818 thread PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m1pF_): non-review completion evidence for
# hosted comment-only reviewers, mirroring exactly what the loop's own
# platform readers accept. Round 16 (threads PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m2Os_,
# PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m2OtD, PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m2OtK) tightened the codex-github
# adapter and added three more:
#   - codex-github: a root PR comment (issue comment) by the bot whose body
#     is SHA-pinned terminal evidence — a backticked "Reviewed commit"
#     marker whose token pins the current head (offset-zero prefix in
#     either direction, the same prefix classification codex_marker_classify
#     accepts) AND the approved clean sentence ("Didn't find any major
#     issues", the approved-template verdict sentence
#     codex-github-reviewer.sh matches). A SHA-pinned body WITHOUT the clean
#     sentence is the loop classifier's unrecognized/needs-fixes verdict
#     (every other terminal body safe-fails) — returned as rc 2, never a
#     pass (round-15's OR over the two markers let a "Codex Review: Needs
#     fixes ... Reviewed commit: <HEAD>" body pass clean).
#   - greptile: a `+1` reaction by the bot on the latest "@greptile review"
#     trigger comment — run_greptile_review's completion signal.
#   - claude-code-action: the loop's claude-code-action-reviewer.sh accepts
#     a successful GitHub Actions run (workflow_dispatch, the configured
#     workflow file, run-name "PR #<n>"-scoped when any candidate carries
#     one, newest by created_at) with no CHANGES_REQUESTED review from the
#     bot — the findings leg is the shared review scan the caller runs.
#   - pr-agent: run_pr_agent_review's completion surface — the latest issue
#     comment by the bot whose body contains "PR Reviewer Guide" and the
#     head SHA, classified by the same label rules _pr_agent_classify
#     applies ("No major issues detected" clean; hard-blocker focus-area
#     labels needs-fixes; unreadable section needs-fixes).
#   - coderabbit-cli / local-ai-reviewer: both reviewer scripts are pure-CLI
#     readers (coderabbit-cli-reviewer.sh and local-ai-reviewer.sh make no
#     `gh api` write call — only `gh pr view` / `gh pr diff`), so neither
#     leaves a review/comment/issue-comment surface of its own; since round
#     17 (PRRT_kwDORWAxaM6m260s) their ONE readable durable surface — the
#     loop's reviewer_loop_history.v1 ledger — IS consumed: a
#     current-head-pinned clean verdict from that ledger (the same
#     #1692-per-head replay evidence pr-review-loop.sh trusts) passes,
#     and absent/stale/not-clean/unreadable ledger evidence still refuses
#     fail-closed (reviewer-check-absent / reviewer-evidence-unreadable).
# On a clean match: sets reviewer_started_at (the evidence's timestamp —
# the comment's created_at / the trigger comment's created_at / the run's
# created_at, the same window start the loop scans findings from) and
# returns 0. Returns 1 when the platform has no readable evidence (caller
# refuses reviewer-check-absent — fail closed for genuinely absent
# evidence). Returns 2 when the platform's own readable evidence is a
# BLOCKING verdict for the current head (caller refuses blocking-findings
# with the needs-fixes annotation). Fetch/parse failures escalate
# fail-closed; a reactions read failure returns 1 (refusal), never a pass.

# `--add-label` binds nothing to a commit: a push landing between the state
# read at the top and this mutation would leave every reviewer/CI verdict

# head immediately before the mutation and refuse on any drift. A *rerun*
# check is equally stale: if the reviewer check run was re-triggered on this
# same head (success → pending/failure) after the verdicts above were read,
# the verdicts describe a superseded run, and re-checking only `headRefOid`
# would apply the label from stale success data (PR #1818 finding 2, round 5).
# A failed or empty revalidation fetch escalates fail-closed as
# `revalidation-unreadable` — never success (PR #1818 finding 1, round 6) —
# and a rerun that completes between the first scan and the revalidation is
# rescanned for findings and availability notices against the newly selected
# run's timestamp, because a same-SHA rerun can conclude `success` while
# posting blocking comments (PR #1818 finding 2, round 6). The same applies
# to CI: a statusCheckRollup re-read must still satisfy the pending/failing
# rules applied at the main gate. The same conclusion→verdict logic is
# reused (reviewer_check_conclusion_is_clean) so the two gates cannot drift
