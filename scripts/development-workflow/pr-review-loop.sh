# used to produce output with no terminal RESULT= line at all. A caller
# grepping for RESULT= finds nothing, and "no blocking findings were reported"

# non-zero in that case (124 from timeout, 143 from SIGTERM), but the exit code
# is precisely what an orchestrator loses when it captures stdout through a

# Execution budget vs. rate-limit ceiling (issue #1562)
#
# These two numbers were in direct tension and nothing reconciled them:
#
#   - The worst-case legitimate CodeRabbit rate-limit wait is
#     CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES x CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT, which at
#     the defaults (4 x 900s) is 3600s — a full hour in which the loop is
#     working correctly and has nothing to report.
#   - A run was killed at roughly 65 minutes of foreground polling during the
#     #1503 work. So the maximum legitimate wait sat within a few minutes of
#     the observed kill threshold.
#
# Two runners then made it worse by wrapping the loop in an outer `timeout`
# SHORTER than a single 900s rate-limit wait, guaranteeing truncation on any
# rate-limited PR.
#
# PR_REVIEW_LOOP_EXECUTION_BUDGET is the wall clock a caller must allow for
# this script. The invariant is checked at startup: the worst-case rate-limit
# wait must be strictly less than the budget, so a correctly-configured run can
# always finish waiting before the budget it declares. Raising the retry count
# or the per-retry wait without also raising the budget is a configuration
# error, and is reported as one rather than discovered as a truncated run an
# hour later.
#
# Callers: allow at least this many seconds. Do NOT wrap this script in a
# `timeout` shorter than it. If you must bound it more tightly, lower
# CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES or CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT and lower the
# budget to match, so the invariant still holds.
# The shipped CodeRabbit rate-limit defaults, declared once. Both the review
# path and the budget invariant below read them from here: the two must agree,
# and they previously restated 4 and 900 independently, which is precisely the
# drift that lets a budget check pass while the real wait is something else.

# CODERABBIT_SKIP_BANNER_RE — matches the CodeRabbit "Review skipped" banner.
#
# CodeRabbit posts this banner instead of a review whenever it declines to review a
# PR by configuration rather than by capacity: `reviews.auto_review.enabled: false`
# ("Auto reviews are disabled on this repository"), `auto_review.drafts: false` on a
# draft PR, or an `auto_review.base_branches` list that does not match the PR base
# (e.g. only `develop` listed while the PR targets a `develop-<slug>` integration
# branch).
#
# It must never be counted as review activity. Before this constant existed, the
# activity probe in run_coderabbit_review excluded only the pause, rate-limit, and
# resume markers, so the skip banner satisfied "CodeRabbit posted something" and
# broke the poll loop into Phase 3 — which then collected zero inline comments and
# zero CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews and returned RESULT=clean for a PR CodeRabbit had
# never looked at. Same false-clean class as #1437 (rate-limited SUCCESS status) and
# the PR #650 pause-banner incident, both already fixed for their own banner shapes.
#
# Deliberately NOT a bare "review skipped" substring match. A genuine walkthrough
# is free to contain that phrase in prose ("this review skipped the generated
# files"), and misclassifying a real review as a banner is the mirror-image
# failure: the loop would ignore an actual review, poll to timeout, and escalate.
# The three alternatives are ordered most to least machine-specific:
#   1. the HTML marker CodeRabbit stamps on skip comments and on no other kind;
#   2. the banner's markdown heading, REQUIRED to carry the blockquote prefix
#      CodeRabbit always renders it with (the banner lives inside a
#      "> [!IMPORTANT]" callout, so the body contains "> ## Review skipped").
#      A bare "## Review skipped" heading is deliberately NOT matched: a genuine
#      comment is free to use that heading, and misclassifying a real review as a
#      banner is the mirror-image failure — the review would be dropped from the
#      activity probe, polled to timeout, and escalated. If the vendor ever drops
#      the callout wrapper, alternative 1 still covers the banner;
#   3. the auto-review-disabled sentence, as a belt-and-braces fallback.
#
# Passed into jq as --arg skip_re with test($skip_re; "i") and to grep -qiE, so it

       ./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh unlock <pr-number>

Runs the automated PR review loop for one or more platforms in sequence. Before
triggering a new review, each platform checks for existing blocking findings. If
any platform reports blocking findings, the script stops immediately and exits 1.
If a platform times out or escalates, the script exits 2. If all configured
platforms are clean or skipped, the script exits 0. If a second instance is
detected for the same PR number, the script emits RESULT=escalate with
REASON=lock_contention and exits 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL).

Subcommands:
  unlock <pr-number>
    Remove the stale lock directory for a PR whose previous run crashed without
    cleaning up. Safe to run when no review loop is actively running for that PR.
    Use this to recover autonomously when lock_contention is reported but the
    recorded PID is no longer alive.

    Example:
      ./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh unlock 123

    The lock directory path is /tmp/pr-review-loop-<pr>.lockdir. You can also
    remove it manually with: rm -rf /tmp/pr-review-loop-<pr>.lockdir

--post-final-summary:
  Compatibility no-op. The script now posts or updates the
  "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" comment on every needs_fixes exit, not only
  final/max-cycle exits. Existing callers may keep passing this flag.

--compare:
  Run all configured platforms to completion regardless of individual verdicts
  (disables the short-circuit on the first blocking platform). After all platforms
  run, the overall exit code and RESULT are identical to what normal mode would
  produce: the first platform that would have blocked in config order governs.
  Per-platform verdicts are emitted as COMPARE_VERDICT_<n>_PLATFORM /
  COMPARE_VERDICT_<n>_RESULT key=value lines, and one row is appended to
  docs/workflow/retro-metrics-platforms.md. Intended for platform evaluation only —
  not for normal orchestration where early exit is desired.

--ready-phase:
  Mark one or more platforms as ready-phase reviewers that should run only after
  draft-phase GitHub reviewers are clean and the PR has been converted with
  gh pr ready. This does not override normal platform order; it emits
  READY_PHASE_* key=value telemetry and compatibility PHASE_AFTER_CLEAN_* keys.
  When omitted, the script reads review.on_ready.github from
  .ai-dev-workflow.yaml when present.

--phase-after-clean:
  Deprecated compatibility alias for --ready-phase.

--draft-github-only:
  Run only review.on_draft.github reviewers. Use this for draft PR gates that
  must clear draft-compatible GitHub reviewers before converting the PR to ready
  and allowing ready-phase reviewers to run.

--pre-after-clean-only:
  Deprecated compatibility alias for --draft-github-only.

Platform selection (in priority order):
  1. --platform flag(s) passed on the command line
  2. review.on_draft.github + review.on_ready.github in .ai-dev-workflow.yaml
     at the repo root
  3. Legacy review.platforms / review.phase_after_clean compatibility mapping

Branch-type-aware default timeout:
  On spec/* and implementation-plan/* branches, Devin has no trigger condition and
  exits immediately with REASON=no_check_run. To avoid wasting the full 20-minute
  default wait budget on these branches, the script automatically reduces
  --max-wait to PR_REVIEW_LOOP_DOC_MAX_WAIT seconds (default: 180) and
  --poll-interval to 30 s when the branch matches spec/* or
  implementation-plan/* and the caller did not pass the respective flag
  explicitly. poll_interval is also reduced when needed so it stays below
  max_wait — the per-loop timeout check requires elapsed >= max_wait, which can
  only fire after at least one poll_interval has elapsed. Pass --max-wait and/or
  --poll-interval explicitly to override either value.

Large-diff poll-window extension:
  CodeRabbit takes significantly longer to post its review on PRs with a large
  number of changed files (e.g., release PRs or sync-template PRs). When the
  caller did not pass --max-wait explicitly, the script fetches the PR's changed-
  files count and extends max_wait when it exceeds a threshold.

  Environment variables (both optional):
    LARGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD  — changed-files count above which the extension applies
                            (default: 50; must be a positive integer)
    LARGE_DIFF_MAX_WAIT   — extended max_wait in seconds for large-diff PRs
                            (default: 2400, i.e. 40 minutes; must be a positive integer)

  The extension is suppressed when --max-wait is passed explicitly. The emitted
  key=value output includes CHANGED_FILES_COUNT so callers can inspect the value.

Outputs stable key=value lines including:
  RESULT=clean|needs_fixes|needs_rerun|waiting_on_reviewer|escalate|skipped
  PLATFORM_<n>_NAME / PLATFORM_<n>_RESULT
  REASON=lock_contention (when exit code is 75)
  CHANGED_FILES_COUNT=<n> (PR's changed-files count, or -1 when the fetch failed)
  LARGE_DIFF_EXTENDED=1 (present and set to 1 when max_wait was extended for a large-diff PR)

    platform_results[] — per-platform normalized outcome + raw RESULT/REASON (no head; heads stay in
      reviewed_heads[] from #1648). Used to select the local reviewer's most recent verdict.
    missed_findings[] — one element per external platform that reported blocking findings this round
      on an attributable commit: reviewer, reviewed_head, blocking_count, full deduped paths,
      path_total, local_evidence_state, and classification (confirmed_miss|possible_miss|not_a_miss).
      Observational only — never changes readiness, labels, or merge decisions. Summary shows one
      ≤200-character line per record. When history is unappendable and a record was owed, the prior
      history block is preserved and the summary reports the telemetry failure.

                  verbatim, or a freshly generated "auto-<epoch>-<pid>-<random>" id when unset. See
                  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_RUN_ID below for why callers should set this explicitly to make the
                  per-run cap meaningful across multiple invocations.)
  CYCLE_COUNT=<n> (PER-RUN cap count — Protocol 91's `cycle` value at the start of this invocation:
                  the number of fixer dispatches already issued for RUN_ID, read from the persisted
                  reviewer_loop_history.v1 ledger; -1 when the ledger could not be read reliably.
                  Resets to 0 at each orchestration-run boundary (i.e. whenever RUN_ID changes).
                  Never reset by a HEAD SHA change alone — see max_cycles below.)
  MAX_CYCLES=<n> (the configured PER-RUN cycle cap; default 10, see PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_CYCLES below)
  TOTAL_CYCLE_COUNT=<n> (LIFETIME ceiling count — the same distinct-HEAD-SHA fixer-dispatch count as
                  CYCLE_COUNT, but across the PR's ENTIRE review-loop lifetime regardless of RUN_ID;
                  never resets. -1 when the ledger could not be read reliably (always -1 exactly when
                  CYCLE_COUNT is also -1 — both come from the same ledger read).)
  MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES=<n> (the configured LIFETIME cycle ceiling; default 25, see
                  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES below)
  REASON=max_cycles_exceeded (RESULT=escalate; emitted when CYCLE_COUNT reaches MAX_CYCLES (the
                  PER-RUN cap) while the loop would otherwise still report needs_fixes or needs_rerun
                  — Protocol 91:1719's cap, conforming verbatim: "Initialize cycle = 0 once per
                  orchestration run ... escalate when the run reaches max_cycles". A "clean" result is
                  never overridden by this check. The cap applies uniformly to every re-invocation of
                  this script within the same RUN_ID regardless of whether the fix that triggered it
                  was applied inline or by a dispatched fixer subagent — there is only one per-run
                  counter.)
  REASON=max_total_cycles_exceeded (RESULT=escalate; emitted when TOTAL_CYCLE_COUNT reaches
                  MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES (the LIFETIME ceiling, which never resets) while the loop would
                  otherwise still report needs_fixes or needs_rerun. Checked only after the per-run
                  cap does not fire, so this REASON specifically signals "many separate orchestration
                  runs, each individually under the per-run cap, cumulatively exceeded the lifetime
                  budget" — distinct from max_cycles_exceeded so an operator can tell the two apart.)
  REASON=cycle_count_unavailable (RESULT=escalate; emitted when CYCLE_COUNT/TOTAL_CYCLE_COUNT are -1
                  — the persisted cycle ledger could not be read after retries — while the loop would
                  otherwise still report needs_fixes or needs_rerun. Fails closed rather than silently
                  disabling both cap backstops indefinitely for this PR.)
  REASON=ledger_persist_failed (RESULT=escalate, exit 2; emitted when this cycle's own
                  reviewer_loop_history.v1 ledger entry could not be reliably written — either
                  because both the PATCH to the existing summary comment and the create-fallback
                  failed, OR because the pre-write READ of the existing comment failed (which makes
                  the write fall back to an "unavailable" stub that silently drops this cycle's entry
                  even when the stub itself is posted successfully) — while this cycle's own result
                  was needs_fixes or needs_rerun. Without this check, the caller would dispatch a
                  fixer for a cycle that a future invocation's cycle count would never see, letting
                  repeated persistence or read failures (e.g. a token that can read but not write
                  comments, or a transient read blip on an otherwise-successful write) slip past both
                  caps indefinitely. Persistence is attempted, and this correction applied, BEFORE
                  RESULT=/REASON= are printed — exactly ONE RESULT= / REASON= pair is ever emitted per
                  invocation, so this REASON is safe to read with either a "first match" or "last
                  match" key=value parser.)
  EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS_REORDERED=1 (emitted once per run when expensive reviewers were moved last
                  within their own phase bucket; never crosses the draft/ready boundary)
  EXPENSIVE_GATE_PLATFORM / EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT / EXPENSIVE_GATE_REASON / EXPENSIVE_GATE_HEAD
  EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS / EXPENSIVE_GATE_MAX_DEFERRALS
                  Emitted per expensive platform (currently codex-github) immediately before dispatch.
                  RESULT is dispatched|deferred|forced|deferral_cap. Conditions are evaluated in order:
                  (1) local-ai-reviewer configured and current-head clean evidence,
                  (2) every preceding peer (same-bucket non-expensive + earlier buckets) has
                  acceptable evidence (clean, or skipped with allow-listed reason),
                  (3) zero unresolved non-outdated review threads on the same head,
                  (4) non-empty non-reviewer baseline checks all green on the same head.
                  Fail-closed on unreadable inputs (evidence_unavailable_*). A deferred outcome sets
                  RESULT=needs_fixes REASON=expensive_gate_deferred so readiness is withheld and
                  Step 7 re-runs; it also breaks the platform iteration so later ready-phase platforms
                  do not run. When the ready-phase transition is about to start and any remaining
                  ready-phase platform is expensive, those expensive gates are preflighted BEFORE
                  gh pr ready with peer scope earlier_buckets (same-bucket peers like bugbot are
                  not required yet — they need ready state themselves); the full per-platform
                  gate still runs again immediately before run_platform_review. Deferrals are bounded
                  by PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS
                  (default 3, head-scoped occurrence count); at the cap the loop escalates.
  EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION=expensive_gate_deferral_cap|expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable
                  Emitted ONLY when EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=deferral_cap — exhausted budget vs
                  unreadable ledger. Absent otherwise.
  REASON=expensive_gate_deferred (RESULT=needs_fixes; expensive reviewer held back)
  REASON=expensive_gate_deferral_cap|expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable (RESULT=escalate)

Environment variables:
  POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_QUIET=<sec>      Consecutive seconds of platform silence required before a clean verdict is
                                     called settled (issue #1556). Defaults per platform: 120 for coderabbit /
                                     coderabbit-cli, 60 otherwise. Any platform activity — including an in-place
                                     EDIT of an existing bot comment — resets this timer.
  POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_WINDOW=<sec>     Maximum total time to spend settling (default: 900 for coderabbit /
                                     coderabbit-cli, 180 otherwise — sized from the measured ~12 min
                                     walkthrough-to-review gap on PR #1573). If the window is exhausted while the platform
                                     is still active, the verdict stays clean but is reported UNSETTLED via
                                     POST_CLEAN_SETTLED=0 and POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_TIMEOUT=1.
  POST_CLEAN_POLL=<seconds>          Interval between settle re-checks (default: 60 for coderabbit /
                                     coderabbit-cli, 30 otherwise).
  POST_CLEAN_REQUIRE_REVIEW=0|1      Whether silence alone may satisfy the settle, or whether a SUBMITTED review
                                     for the current HEAD is required first (default: 1 for coderabbit /
                                     coderabbit-cli, 0 otherwise). CodeRabbit posts a walkthrough issue comment
                                     within a minute of the push and then submits the actual review much later —
                                     twelve minutes, measured on PR #1573 — so silence in between means it is
                                     still working, not that it finished. When no review arrives inside the
                                     window the verdict stays clean but reports POST_CLEAN_NO_SUBMITTED_REVIEW=1
                                     alongside POST_CLEAN_SETTLED=0.
  <PLATFORM>_POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_QUIET / _SETTLE_WINDOW / _POLL
                                     Per-platform overrides, taking precedence over the generic forms above.
                                     The platform name is upper-cased with '-' replaced by '_', except that
                                     coderabbit-cli shares the CODERABBIT_ prefix. Example:
                                     CODERABBIT_POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_QUIET=240
                                     When several platforms are configured, the LONGEST window and quiet period
                                     across them are used — any of them can be the one that posts late.
  POST_CLEAN_WAIT=<seconds>          Legacy alias, still honoured: sets the quiet period when no more specific
                                     POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_QUIET (generic or per-platform) is set.
  SKIP_POST_CLEAN_RECHECK=1          Suppress the post-clean recheck. Set by callers re-dispatching after a prior
                                     late-thread fix cycle, so the corrective invocation does not recheck again.
  FALLBACK_THREAD_SETTLE_WAIT=<sec>  Seconds to wait before running the thread audit when using
                                     coderabbit_status_success_fallback (default: 60). CodeRabbit can set a
                                     SUCCESS commit status before finishing its async inline-thread posting; this
                                     wait lets those threads arrive so the audit does not produce a false-clean.
  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_CYCLES=<n>      Override the PER-RUN reviewer-loop cycle cap (default: 10, matching
                                     Protocol 91:1719's documented value). Also configurable via review.max_cycles
                                     in .ai-dev-workflow.yaml; this env var takes precedence over the config file.
  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES=<n> Override the LIFETIME reviewer-loop cycle ceiling (default: 25). Also
                                     configurable via review.max_total_cycles in .ai-dev-workflow.yaml; this env
                                     var takes precedence over the config file.
  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_RUN_ID=<id>         Set by an orchestrator to group multiple pr-review-loop.sh invocations
                                     under one Protocol-91-style "orchestration run", so the per-run cap
                                     (CYCLE_COUNT/MAX_CYCLES) accumulates correctly across those invocations and
                                     resets when the orchestrator starts a genuinely new run with a new id. When
                                     unset, each invocation is treated as its own isolated run for per-run-cap
                                     purposes (CYCLE_COUNT effectively stays 0) — the LIFETIME ceiling
                                     (TOTAL_CYCLE_COUNT/MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES) still enforces regardless.
  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS=<n>
                                     Bound on head-scoped expensive-reviewer gate deferrals (default: 3).
                                     Valid range 1–999999; invalid values WARN and fall back to 3.
  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_FORCE_EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS=1
                                     Bypass the expensive-reviewer gate for manual escalation. The gate still
                                     evaluates and emits EXPENSIVE_GATE_* with RESULT=forced and the reason it
                                     would have deferred; justify use in the PR.
  PR_REVIEW_LOOP_SMALL_FINDINGS_STOP_ROUNDS=<n>
                                     Consecutive small-findings rounds required before RESULT=clean with
                                     REASON=small_findings_terminal (default: 2; valid range 1–999). A round
                                     qualifies only when every blocking finding is small under the two-tier
                                     rule (normative documents are never small; other non-shipped paths are
                                     small unless the body touches a contract surface), the strict thread
                                     audit is zero, and both prior counted rounds and the deciding round are
                                     on the current PR head for every contributing platform. See Protocol 93.
  SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY=<cause>  Emitted when the small-findings terminal rule does not fire for a content
                                     or currency cause: shipped_path | contract_surface | stale_head |
                                     head_unknown. Within-group precedence: shipped_path over contract_surface;
                                     stale_head over head_unknown. Empty when the rule fired or the run was
                                     simply short. Contract-surface identities include acceptance_criteria,
                                     decision_gates_and_matrices, parser_and_input_behavior, scope_and_coverage,

  # "Root" means in_reply_to_id == null (the original comment, not a reply).
  #
  # Unlike check_unresolved_threads (GraphQL reviewThreads), this uses the REST
  # pulls-comments endpoint which includes outside-diff comments (line == null /
  # "LNone" in the GitHub UI). These outside-diff comments never create proper
  # GitHub review threads and are therefore invisible to the GraphQL query, but
  # they appear in the GitHub PR page as unresolved findings that reviewers can see.
  #
  # A root comment is considered "replied" when at least one reply comment exists
  # whose author is NOT the CodeRabbit bot (i.e., a human or agent acknowledgment).
  # CodeRabbit's own auto-acknowledgment replies do not count.
  # Comments containing "✅ Addressed" in the body are also excluded (self-resolved).
  #
  # Root REST comments whose corresponding GraphQL review thread is already resolved
  # (isResolved=true) are also excluded. This prevents false-positive "unreplied"
  # counts when a reviewer resolves a thread via the GitHub UI without adding a reply:
  # the GraphQL isResolved flag reflects the true resolved state, so any REST comment
  # that belongs to an already-resolved thread must not block the review loop.
  # The caller supplies the set of resolved root comment database IDs via $4.
  #
  # Arguments:
  #   $1  pr_number              - PR number (integer)
  #   $2  repo                   - "owner/repo" slug
  #   $3  bot_login              - Full bot login including [bot] suffix (e.g. "coderabbitai[bot]")
  #                                REST API returns the full login; unlike GraphQL, no stripping needed.
  #   $4  resolved_ids_json      - (optional) JSON array of integer database IDs for root comments
  #                                whose GraphQL thread is already resolved (isResolved=true).
  #                                Pass "[]" or omit to skip this filter.
  #
  # Prints the count of unreplied root CodeRabbit comments on stdout.

# limit", so matching only the existing test("rate.?limit"; "i") comment-marker
# regex used elsewhere in this script would miss it. The pattern below matches
# both: the generic "rate limit" phrasing (kept for consistency with the
# existing comment-marker regex, in case CodeRabbit also uses that wording in
# a status description) AND the confirmed "review limit" / "next review
# available" banner wording. Checking .state alone treats either case as a
# completed clean review — a false clean. Both coderabbit_status_success_fallback
# call sites in run_coderabbit_review use this helper so the description guard
# is applied identically at both sites.

# coderabbit_no_trigger_timeout_default <max_wait>
#
# Computes the default silent-non-trigger fallback timeout (issue #1433):
# how long run_coderabbit_review waits with zero CodeRabbit activity before
# proactively posting "@coderabbitai review" (see the "Auto-retrigger: detect
# CodeRabbit silent non-trigger after push" block below).
#
# Background: the previous fixed default was 600 s, decoupled from max_wait.
# Two problems: (1) on the common default invocation (max_wait=1200 s), it
# burned up to 10 minutes of pure idle wait before nudging CodeRabbit — the
# exact "waited out CodeRabbit auto-trigger timeouts" latency reported in
# #1433 from the #1429/#1431 retrospective; (2) on short-max_wait
# invocations (e.g. the 180 s spec/*  and implementation-plan/* doc-branch
# default — see the "Branch-type-aware default timeout" section in --help),
# elapsed could never reach 600 before the outer max_wait timeout exits the
# loop, so the silent-non-trigger safety net never had a chance to fire at
# all on those branches.
#
# Fix: default to 180 s — the "give CodeRabbit time, then nudge" cadence
# CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT originally shared. The two knobs have since
# diverged deliberately and must not be re-coupled: this one waits out a
# *silent* CodeRabbit (nothing posted at all), where 3 minutes is ample and a
# longer wait is pure idle latency, while CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT waits out
# an *acknowledged* vendor quota block whose reset is hourly, so it is now
# sized in quarter-hours (see its declaration in run_coderabbit_review).
#
# Effective-timeout rule (piecewise, by max_wait):
#   - max_wait >= 360 s: effective = 180 s (the hardcoded default; the half-
#     max_wait cap below does not bind).
#   - 60 s <= max_wait < 360 s: effective = floor(max_wait / 2) (the cap
#     binds and is always < max_wait, so a subsequent poll cycle is
#     guaranteed to have room before the outer max_wait timeout).
#   - max_wait < 60 s: effective = max(30, floor(max_wait / 2)) — the 30 s
#     floor takes precedence over the halved cap in this range. For
#     max_wait <= ~30 s this can leave little or no room before the outer
#     timeout (the floor exists only so a pathologically small max_wait
#     still gets one nudge attempt rather than a zero-second window). This
#     repo never configures --max-wait below 180 s (the doc-branch default;
#     see PR_REVIEW_LOOP_DOC_MAX_WAIT in --help), so this range is a
#     defensive edge case, not a realistic operating point.
#
# This is purely a *timing* change: it does not touch, weaken, or bypass the
# coderabbit_success_status_count description guard (#1437) that prevents a
# rate-limited "success" commit status from being treated as a real clean
# review — that check runs unconditionally on whatever HEAD SHA state exists
# when it is reached, regardless of how quickly this function got there.
#

# env var override is honored as-is (uncapped) by the caller, matching how

#     **Next included review available in 27 minutes.**

# Sizing the retry wait from that sentence rather than from a fixed constant is
# what lets a retry land when the vendor can actually answer. See issue #1579:
# measured on 2026-08-24 the org allowance was 1 review per hour, against which
# a fixed 4 x 900 s budget spends every retry inside a window that grants at
# most one review, then escalates at roughly the moment the review becomes
# available (PR #1589: four retries, four "Reviews resumed" acknowledgements,
# zero reviews, then RESULT=escalate REASON=rate_limit_max_retries).
#
# Args:
#   $1 - body of the newest CodeRabbit rate-limit comment (may be empty)
#   $2 - fallback wait in seconds, used when the sentence is absent or

#
# Prints the wait in seconds on stdout, always a positive integer.
#
# CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT_BUFFER (default 30) is added to the stated window
# so the retry lands just after the vendor boundary rather than exactly on it.
# CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT_MAX (default 3600) clamps the result so that a

# run for a day. Both are validated here: a non-numeric or non-positive

# suppressed every later trigger on that HEAD forever. Measured on PR #1575: a
# rate-limit comment at 16:06 was still being treated as live 21 hours later,
# with no CodeRabbit activity of any kind in between, and the loop waited out
# its whole retry budget without ever posting a fresh review request.

# it (#1579).
# Exit status is the caller's signal, and the three cases are NOT equivalent:

#   0 with nothing - the lookup succeeded and there is no rate-limit comment
#   2              - the lookup could not be performed

# `|| printf ''`, so a failed `gh api` (network, auth, secondary rate limit)
# was indistinguishable from "no rate-limit comment". Both call sites then
# concluded CodeRabbit was not rate limited and posted a fresh

        #     the recommended setting when coderabbit runs in on_ready.github — collects
        #     a "Review skipped / Draft detected" banner on every PR while it is still a
        #     draft, timestamped after the HEAD commit. Without the latest constraint,
        #     every subsequent ready-phase timeout would report review_skipped_banner
        #     even when CodeRabbit had since posted a pause or rate-limit notice.
        #
        #   - "Latest comment overall" (no window constraint) blames a banner from a
        #     PREVIOUS HEAD. Push a new commit after a draft-phase banner and that
        #     banner is still the newest comment on the PR, so a silent or rate-limited
        #     review of the *current* HEAD would be reported as a configuration problem.
        #
        # Taking the latest in-window comment also yields correctly to the pause and
        # rate-limit handlers below whenever CodeRabbit has since said something more
        # specific. updated_at is accepted alongside created_at because CodeRabbit
        # revises its existing comment in place rather than always posting a new one.
        #
        # For the same reason the sort key is the EFFECTIVE event time,
        # updated_at // created_at, not created_at. Admitting a comment on updated_at
        # and then ordering on created_at contradicts itself: an older comment that
        # CodeRabbit edited a moment ago is genuinely the most recent thing it said,
        # but a created_at sort would rank a banner posted in between above it. That is
        # not hypothetical — on PR #1532 the walkthrough comment was created at 23:23
        # and revised at 23:52, straddling later comments.

This file is append-only. One row is appended per compare-mode reviewer loop run.
Do not delete or rewrite existing rows. The "Block Was Real Bug?" column may be
filled in manually after a run when post-hoc analysis determines whether a
platform-exclusive blocking finding corresponded to a real code defect.

## Graduation Criteria

A platform may be considered safe for removal when, across 30 or more consecutive
compare-mode runs covering at least one run each of \`fix\`, \`feature\`, and \`refactor\`
branch types, it has zero platform-exclusive blocking findings (runs where that
platform blocked but at least one other configured platform was clean).

Fewer than 30 runs is always insufficient data for a graduation decision.

# restore_regression_label_if_missing — Step 7b regression-label auto-restore.
# Re-applies the ready-for-regression label at the start of every pr-review-loop.sh
# invocation for implementation branches so the label is always present when the CI
# loop (Step 8) begins — eliminating the recurring manual re-application pattern.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1  pr_number   — numeric PR number
#   $2  branch_name — full branch ref (e.g. fix/805-slug)
#
# Behaviour:
#   - Runs only for feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*, hotfix/* branches.
#   - Checks current label state via `gh pr view --json labels`.
#     On gh failure the check is skipped (fail-open; WARN emitted to stderr).
#   - When the label is absent, gates the restore on current-head clean-loop
#     evidence from the newest "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" comment:
#       • latest summary result clean/skipped + head_sha matches current PR head
#         → RESTORE.
#       • no summary, stale-head summary, non-clean summary, or unreadable
#         summary history → do NOT restore.
#     This keeps the helper aligned with the PR policy workflow: a historical
#     clean summary must not resurrect ready-for-regression after later pushes
#     introduce reviewer findings.
#   - If the comment-presence query fails (gh/API error): fail-open — the restore
#     IS attempted and a WARN is emitted. This mirrors the higher-frequency
#     real-world failure (#805) being more harmful than a spurious re-apply.
#   - The operation is idempotent: if the label is already present, gh pr edit
#     --add-label is a documented no-op.
#   - Marker: "### Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" (author-agnostic; the comment
#     is posted by the maintainer's gh token when run locally, not necessarily by
#     a bot account). Do NOT scope by [bot] — that silently misses local-run cases.
#
# Returns 0 in all cases (best-effort; never aborts the caller).

# Protocol 93 documents a hard cycle cap ("a hard limit independent of
# finding counts") but nothing enforced it — the loop relied entirely on the
# calling orchestrator/agent to count cycles and escalate manually. Evidence:
# PR #1492 in this repository reached 18 reviewer-loop iterations against a
# documented cap of 10 (see reviewer_loop_history.v1 on that PR) with no
# max_cycles escalation. This block makes the script itself the source of
# truth for the cycle count and the enforcement point, independent of
# whatever the caller does or fails to do.
#
# TWO independent caps, per operator decision on PR #1507's review:
#
#   1. Per-run cap (CYCLE_COUNT / MAX_CYCLES, review.max_cycles, default 10):
#      resets to 0 at each orchestration-run boundary. This conforms to
#      Protocol 91:1719 verbatim: "Initialize cycle = 0 once per
#      orchestration run for the PR. Increment cycle each time a fixer
#      agent is dispatched. Do not reset cycle after a fixer push; escalate
#      when the run reaches max_cycles." Escalates with
#      REASON=max_cycles_exceeded.
#   2. Lifetime ceiling (TOTAL_CYCLE_COUNT / MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES,
#      review.max_total_cycles, default 25): never resets, counts across
#      the PR's entire review-loop lifetime regardless of run boundaries.
#      Escalates with the distinct REASON=max_total_cycles_exceeded.
#
# Why both, not either/or: a per-run-only cap leaves total effort unbounded
# — a PR resumed across many separate orchestration runs gets a fresh
# budget every time, which is exactly the "runs until someone notices"
# failure #1502 exists to end (the ~50-cycle / 18-hour downstream incident
# cited in #1502 plausibly spanned multiple runs). A lifetime-only cap
# contradicts Protocol 91:1719's explicit "initialize cycle = 0 once per
# orchestration run" instruction. Both together satisfy each: the per-run
# cap matches the protocol exactly, and the lifetime ceiling is the
# structural backstop that does not depend on every caller correctly
# threading a stable run identifier through every invocation.
#
# What is counted (both caps): fixer-dispatch-triggering cycles. Only prior
# ledger entries whose `result` is `needs_fixes` or `needs_rerun` are
# candidates — each such result is exactly the trigger condition for a
# fixer dispatch (or, for needs_rerun, PR-Agent's equivalent auto-push
# retry). The initial review and any `clean`/`skipped` entries are excluded.
# Among candidates, only DISTINCT (HEAD SHA, result) PAIRS are counted (not
# raw entry count, and not distinct HEAD SHA alone): a completed fixer
# cycle is required to push a new commit before the next review runs
# (Protocol 93's mandatory push-once-per-cycle discipline), so two
# candidates sharing one HEAD SHA AND the SAME result mean no fix was
# actually applied between them (a restarted runner, a duplicate/retried
# invocation, or a review re-run before the orchestrator dispatched a
# fixer) and must not be double-counted. Deduping by HEAD SHA alone would
# be too aggressive: a needs_rerun entry (PR-Agent's auto-push evaluation
# completing a fix cycle) immediately followed by a needs_fixes entry on
# THAT SAME resulting HEAD SHA (a different reviewer finding a NEW,
# unrelated issue on the post-auto-fix state) are two genuinely distinct
# dispatch events, not a duplicate of one — collapsing them into one would
# let more than the configured number of real fixes happen before either
# cap fires (found in review of PR #1507). Keying on (head_sha, result)
# instead of head_sha alone dedupes true duplicates (same head_sha AND
# same result — no progress since the last check) while still counting a
# needs_rerun→needs_fixes sequence on the same head_sha as two events.
#
# Run-boundary tracking (schema, chosen deliberately as an ADDITIVE field,
# not a schema version bump): each ledger entry now carries an optional
# `run_id` string, resolved once per invocation by
# reviewer_loop_resolve_run_id and threaded into
# reviewer_loop_history_build_entry via the `current_run_id` global (the
# same pattern already used for `unresolved_thread_count`/`late_thread_count`
# in that function — no signature change needed). An additive optional
# field (not a `reviewer_loop_history.v2` schema bump) was chosen because:
#   - It is fully backward- and forward-compatible: every existing
#     `.schema == "reviewer_loop_history.v1"` check across this script
#     continues to validate unchanged, and no in-flight PR's already-
#     recorded history needs migrating mid-flight.
#   - The field is genuinely optional at read time (see back-compat policy
#     below), so there is no ambiguity a version bump would need to resolve.
#
# Back-compat policy for entries with no `run_id` (written by the
# pre-dual-cap version of this script — this literally happened on PR #1507
# itself, cycles 1-5, before this field existed): such entries ARE counted
# toward the LIFETIME ceiling (they represent real historical fixer
# dispatches — the lifetime cap must not blind itself to real prior
# effort), but they can NEVER satisfy any specific per-run count, because
# an entry with no `run_id` cannot match any current invocation's
# (non-empty) resolved run_id. This means an old PR does not get an
# artificially reset per-run budget just because its early history predates
# run-id tracking — the lifetime ceiling still sees that history — while
# the per-run counter correctly starts fresh for the first run-id-aware
# invocation (since no prior entry could possibly match a brand-new run id).
#
# Reset semantic per axis (deliberately NOT reset-on-new-head-SHA on
# EITHER axis): a genuinely new HEAD SHA always adds to both counts; this
# is the opposite of the "reset on new push" option the originating issue
# offered as an alternative, and the choice is deliberate on this axis
# specifically: the motivating failure (PR #1492, 18 cycles) involved a new
# HEAD SHA on nearly every cycle, because each cycle's fix is a new commit.
# A reset-on-head-change design would set both counters back to 0 on almost
# every invocation and would never have caught that exact case.
#
# The inline-fix retry lane (Protocol 93's "fast lane" for mechanical fixes)
# is bounded by the same two counters without any extra logic: every
# re-invocation of this script — whether triggered by an inline fix or a
# dispatched fixer subagent — reads the same persisted ledger and is
# subject to the same caps.

# reviewer_loop_resolve_run_id
#
# Resolves the run identifier for this invocation. Precedence:
#   1. PR_REVIEW_LOOP_RUN_ID env var — set by an orchestrator that wants to
#      group multiple pr-review-loop.sh invocations under one
#      Protocol-91-style "orchestration run" (so the per-run cap
#      accumulates correctly across those invocations, and resets when the
#      orchestrator starts a genuinely new run with a new id).
#   2. A freshly generated id (`auto-<epoch seconds>-<pid>-<$RANDOM>`) when
#      the env var is not set. Each such auto-generated invocation is, by
#      construction, its own isolated "run" for per-run cap purposes — no
#      prior ledger entry can share a freshly generated id — so the per-run
#      cap effectively becomes a no-op unless the caller opts in by setting
#      PR_REVIEW_LOOP_RUN_ID consistently across a session. The LIFETIME
#      ceiling is unaffected by this and still enforces regardless of
#      caller participation, which is exactly why both caps exist together.

#            "needs_fixes" or "needs_rerun", with a non-empty head_sha),
#            regardless of run_id — i.e. the lifetime-ceiling count — or -1
#            when that count cannot be determined reliably. Keying on the
#            pair rather than head_sha alone counts a needs_rerun entry
#            immediately followed by a needs_fixes entry on the SAME
#            resulting head_sha as two distinct dispatches (a completed
#            auto-fix, then a different NEW issue found on that state) —
#            see the block comment above for why deduping by head_sha
#            alone would be too aggressive.
#   run_count — the same DISTINCT-(head_sha,result)-PAIR count, but
#            restricted to entries whose `run_id` field exactly equals
#            <run_id> — i.e. the per-run-cap count (Protocol 91's `cycle`

#            Entries with no `run_id` (back-compat, pre-dual-cap entries)
#            never match and are excluded from this count, but ARE still
#            included in lifetime_count (see the back-compat policy in the

# Post-clean settle window (issue #1556)
#
# The old behaviour was a single 30-second wait followed by one thread re-query.
# That is far too short for CodeRabbit, which posts findings minutes after it
# first goes quiet. Measured: PR #1532 two late findings, #1541 three across
# three rounds, #1555 five across two rounds, and again during #1537/#1562 —
# eight on one PR across two post-clean rounds, two of them Major. Every late
# finding was real. Nothing escaped only because runners were told to hold a
# 2-3 minute quiet window and re-query by hand, which is operator discipline
# standing in for a tooling guarantee.
#
# The verdict now means "clean, and still clean after the vendor went quiet":
# poll until the platform has produced NO activity for a full quiet period, or
# until the overall window is exhausted. Any activity resets the quiet timer,
# because a vendor that just spoke is likely to speak again.
#
# _settle_config_for_platform <platform> — echoes "window quiet poll" seconds.
#
# Per-platform (AC-4), because vendors differ by an order of magnitude and a
# window sized for the slowest would tax every other platform. Resolution
# order, most specific first:
#   1. <PLATFORM>_POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_WINDOW / _QUIET / _POLL   (e.g. CODERABBIT_)
#   2. POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_WINDOW / POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_QUIET / POST_CLEAN_POLL
#   3. the per-platform defaults below
#
# POST_CLEAN_WAIT is still honoured as the quiet period when nothing more
# specific is set, so existing callers keep working.

  # into $comment_body) was never actually written to the PR. If the caller
  # does not react to this, the next invocation's reviewer_loop_resolve_
  # cycle_counts call re-reads the unchanged, stale ledger — the fixer still
  # gets dispatched, but that dispatch is never counted, and repeated
  # persistence failures (e.g. a token that can read but not write
  # comments) would let unbounded cycles slip past both caps (found in
  # review of PR #1507). Return non-zero so the caller (which invokes this
  # function BEFORE printing RESULT=/REASON=, specifically so a correction
  # here happens before anything is emitted — see the call site) can
  # correct aggregate_result to escalate/ledger_persist_failed and still
  # emit exactly ONE RESULT=/REASON= pair. An earlier design printed RESULT=
  # twice and relied on a "last line wins" parsing convention; that was

# --- Post-clean recheck ---
# After the reviewer loop exits clean and the immediate thread gate passes,
# wait a short interval and re-query reviewThreads. This catches bot review
# threads (e.g. CodeRabbit) that are posted asynchronously and arrive after
# the platform handlers and thread gate have already completed. Without this
# recheck, Step 5.1 must catch these late threads — at the cost of a full
# reviewer-loop redispatch cycle. The recheck adds a single ~30-second wait
# in exchange for avoiding that more expensive recovery path.
#
# The recheck only runs when:
#   - aggregate_result is "clean" after the immediate thread gate
#   - compare_mode is not active (recheck is not meaningful in evaluation mode)
#   - SKIP_POST_CLEAN_RECHECK is not set to "1" (allows callers to suppress
#     on re-dispatch after a prior late-thread fix cycle, so the recheck does
#     not run again on the corrective invocation)
#
# Configurable via POST_CLEAN_WAIT env var (default: 30 seconds).
# Emits POST_CLEAN_RECHECK=1 when the wait-and-recheck runs, and

# of them can be the one that posts late, so the window must accommodate the

# Reviewer cycle cap enforcement (#1502, dual-cap): the just-pushed fix (if
# any) has already been given its chance to be verified above — this run
# completed a full review pass like any other. Only now, with the settled
# aggregate result in hand, do we check whether either cap has been
# reached. A "clean" result is never overridden. An already-"escalate"
# result keeps its own (more specific) reason rather than being relabeled.
# This MUST run before the persistence step, compare-mode metrics-row
# append, and the single RESULT= print below: --compare mode's own
# contract is "the overall exit code and RESULT are identical to what
# normal mode would produce" (see the script's usage doc), and these
# overrides are unconditional (they also apply in --compare mode) — so the
# metrics row and the printed RESULT must reflect the post-override
# result, not a stale pre-cap value.
#
# Order: unavailable (fail-closed) first, then the per-run cap
# (max_cycles_exceeded — the Protocol-91-aligned, more specific signal),
# then the lifetime ceiling (max_total_cycles_exceeded — the structural
# backstop). Both counts fail together (-1/-1) when the ledger could not be
# read, so the unavailable check only needs to inspect one of them.
