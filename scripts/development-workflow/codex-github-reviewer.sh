# codex-github-reviewer.sh — Codex GitHub App reviewer path for Step 7a
#
# Implements the trigger/poll/parse loop for the Codex GitHub bot reviewer.
# Classifies as universally reachable: requires only gh CLI access (no Codex
# CLI runtime), so it works from Claude Code, Cursor, headless CI, and any
# context where `gh` is authenticated.
#
# Usage:
#   codex-github-reviewer.sh <pr_number> <owner> <repo> [options]
#
# Options:
#   --trigger-phrase <phrase>   Trigger phrase to post. Default: "@codex review"
#                               Also overridable via CODEX_GITHUB_TRIGGER_PHRASE env var.
#   --bot-login     <login>     GitHub login of the Codex bot account.
#                               Default: "chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]"
#                               Also overridable via CODEX_GITHUB_BOT_LOGIN env var.
#                               Verify the actual bot login from your GitHub App settings.
#   --poll-interval  <seconds>   Seconds between polling attempts. Default: 60
#   --max-wait       <seconds>   Maximum total wait time for bot response across
#                                all attempts. Default: 1800
#   --pre-trigger-wait <seconds> Seconds to wait for existing current-head Codex
#                                evidence before posting a trigger. Default: 60
#                                Set to 0 to skip the pre-trigger check.
#   --max-retriggers <count>     How many times to re-post the trigger after a timeout
#                                before giving up. Default: 1 (so up to 2 attempts total).
#                                Set to 0 to disable retriggering.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — APPROVED   (bot responded with no blocking findings)
#   1 — NEEDS_REVISION (bot responded with blocking findings)
#   2 — TIMED_OUT  (API/auth/setup failures while waiting; treat as unavailable
#                   under configured internal_reviewers_unavailable_policy)
#   3 — UNAVAILABLE (bot responded with review-capacity/quota exhaustion)
#   4 — WAITING_ON_REVIEWER (current-head trigger exists, no bot review yet)
#
# Verdict parsing (three-path, blocking markers checked first per safe-fail):
#   1. Blocking markers present → NEEDS_REVISION (exit 1)
#      Markers (case-insensitive): "changes requested", "blocking issues:" (colon
#      required), "blocking finding", "blocking:", "must fix", "action required",
#      "required:", "❌"
#      Note: "blocking issues:" (with colon) disambiguates the list form from
#      "no blocking issues found"; bare "blocking" excluded (too broad).
#   2. Whole-body exact template match → APPROVED (exit 0)
#      The entire, untruncated response — whitespace-normalized, nothing
#      truncated or discarded — must reproduce, character for character, one
#      of the small set of clean-response templates in
#      CODEX_APPROVED_TEMPLATES (captured verbatim from real Codex responses,
#      each including the complete vendor <details> "About Codex in GitHub"
#      footer). There is no vocabulary list, no grammar, and no
#      case-insensitive or punctuation-tolerant matching — see
#      codex_response_is_approved below and issue #1491's implementation plan
#      (Decisions 1, 2, 5) for the full rationale. Only a submitted review
#      pinned to the current head, or a root PR comment that names the
#      current head in a Reviewed commit marker (terminal evidence), is ever
#      tested against this match. Other Codex root PR comments and
#      thumbs-up reactions are acknowledgements only; they are not SHA-pinned
#      review evidence and must not approve the PR by themselves.
#   3. Neither found, and evidence is terminal → safe-fails to NEEDS_REVISION
#      (exit 1). A bare acknowledgement comment on NON-terminal evidence
#      instead causes the poll loop to keep waiting for real evidence — this
#      wait is gated on the evidence being non-terminal (Decision 6), so a
#      footer-bearing near-miss on genuinely terminal evidence always
#      safe-fails rather than being misrouted to a wait/timeout.
#
# Response source detection (two sources polled each cycle):
#   - issues/{PR}/comments — plain PR comments; matches both BOT_LOGIN and
#     BOT_LOGIN_PLAIN (login without [bot] suffix). Codex posts "clean" results
#     here from the non-[bot] account (e.g. "chatgpt-codex-connector").
#   - pulls/{PR}/reviews   — GitHub Review objects; matches both logins. Codex
#     posts findings here from the [bot]-suffixed account. Only submitted
#     reviews whose commit_id exactly matches the full current head SHA are
#     considered.
#     The review body safe-fails to NEEDS_REVISION, which causes
#     pr-review-loop.sh to count unresolved inline threads.
#
# Idempotency (BR-10):
#   Before posting a trigger comment, the script queries existing PR comments
#   for a trigger comment authored by a human/runner user (not the bot) that
#   contains the current commit SHA. If found, the trigger post is skipped and
#   polling proceeds from the existing trigger timestamp.

# All classification helpers below match against the response via a
# here-string (`<<<`), not a piped `printf`. A here-string is written to a
# temp file/buffer by the shell BEFORE the command starts reading, so a
# `grep -q` match that closes its input early (as soon as it finds a
# match, per POSIX/GNU semantics) can never cause the writer side to
# receive SIGPIPE — unlike `printf | grep -q`, where an early match on a
# response large enough to require multiple pipe writes can SIGPIPE the
# still-writing printf. This matters once classification runs on the
# FULL, untruncated response (see BOT_RESPONSE_FULL below) rather than a
# pre-truncated copy.

# Returns true if the response contains a fence-opener marker (2+
# consecutive backticks, or 3+ consecutive tildes) ANYWHERE. Used by
# codex_response_is_usage_limit and codex_response_is_environment_error
# below as a conservative guard (no longer by codex_response_is_approved,
# which — since issue #1491's conservative-verdict-classifier redesign,
# Decision 1 — is a whole-body exact-template match with no fence-presence
# check of its own; a fence character inside the body is just extra text
# that already breaks the exact match): a genuine SHA-pinned clean review
# can QUOTE example text inside a fenced block (e.g. demonstrating what a
# usage-limit notice looks like) without that text being a genuine
# assertion, and after 5 rounds of precisely parsing GFM's fence-open/
# close semantics repeatedly surfaced the next undiscovered edge case
# (see codex_strip_quoted_spans below), the project's chosen direction is
# to stop trying to determine what's inside vs. outside a fence and
# instead treat the mere PRESENCE of a fence marker as disqualifying for
# any of these positive/actionable classifications. This was initially
# added only to codex_response_is_approved, but the SAME ambiguity
# applies equally to usage-limit and environment-error detection — a
# fenced example that merely QUOTES quota/setup-error wording must not
# trigger an actual UNAVAILABLE verdict for an otherwise clean review
# (fresh evidence from PR #1490 finding 3796042503, a followup to
# 3795661290: the fence guard was added to codex_response_is_approved
# alone, but codex_response_is_usage_limit's own callers were unguarded,
# so fenced quota text still triggered a false UNAVAILABLE for a clean
# review). Embedding this check INSIDE each shared classifier — rather
# than requiring every call site to remember to apply it — is deliberate:
# scattering the guard across call sites is exactly the pattern that
# produced this gap in the first place (codex_response_is_blocking
# learned the same lesson earlier for quote-stripping, PR #1490 finding
# 3793367887).
#
# The backtick threshold was lowered from 3+ to 2+ after
# codex_strip_quoted_spans' naive `[^\`]*` backtick-pair regex was found
# to mishandle CommonMark's actual delimiter-run matching: a code span
# CAN be delimited by a run of 2+ backticks (not just a single pair), and
# the opening/closing runs must be equal length — but the naive regex
# treats an adjacent 2-backtick run as two separate EMPTY single-backtick
# pairs (each backtick immediately "closes" against its neighbor with
# zero content between), stripping only the empty delimiter pairs
# themselves and leaving the actual enclosed content fully exposed (e.g.
# a double-backtick-quoted `` `` No blocking issues found `` `` survived
# stripping intact and matched CODEX_APPROVAL_PATTERN, fresh evidence
# from PR #1490 finding 3798756834). Rather than write CommonMark-
# compliant delimiter-run matching in regex (not realistically
# expressible as a plain substitution), a 2+-backtick run now disqualifies
# the same way a 3+ run always has — single backtick PAIRS (exactly one
# backtick on each side, still extremely common in genuinely clean review
# comments) are unaffected and still get precise stripping via
# codex_strip_quoted_spans. Tildes are NOT lowered to 2+: GFM only uses
# tildes for FENCED code blocks (3+ required), never for inline code
# spans, so a lower tilde threshold would have no corresponding real gap
# to close.

# Blocking/approval marker patterns, centralized so every classification site
# (main poll, async grace, async-final, async-reaction-final) uses the exact
# same rules. See "Verdict parsing" header comment for the rationale behind
# each marker.
#
# Explicit merge-refusal verdicts (e.g. "should not be merged", "do not
# merge", "cannot be merged") are a separate signal the negated-approval
# mechanism below (CODEX_NEGATED_APPROVAL_PATTERN) cannot catch: that
# mechanism only fires when a negation word is followed by one of a
# fixed list of approval-vocabulary target words (approve[ds]?, lgtm,
# looks good, etc.) within the same sentence, but a response like "This
# looks good at first glance, but this should not be merged until tests
# pass." negates "merged" — a word outside that target list entirely —
# so the negated-approval check never matches and the earlier "looks
# good" phrase alone wins, returning APPROVED. This was FIRST fixed by
# manually enumerating one phrasing at a time directly in
# CODEX_BLOCKING_PATTERN — "(should|must) not be merged" (fresh evidence
# from PR #1490 finding 3798880969), then "do not merge"/"don't merge"
# (finding 3798999561) — and each fix immediately surfaced the next
# unenumerated synonym ("cannot be merged", finding 3799159335),
# confirming this is the SAME kind of open-ended-vocabulary problem
# CODEX_NEGATED_APPROVAL_PATTERN already solved by construction rather
# than by enumeration. CODEX_MERGE_REFUSAL_PATTERN below reuses
# CODEX_NEGATION_WORDS (defined further down) the same way
# CODEX_NEGATED_APPROVAL_PATTERN does, against a "merge(d)" target,
# so any negation word already known to this file — including future
# additions to CODEX_NEGATION_WORDS — automatically covers merge
# refusals too, without needing its own one-off enumeration. Checked
# here, in CODEX_BLOCKING_PATTERN (evaluated first in the
# verdict-parsing chain, before approval), an explicit refusal to merge
# is recognized as blocking outright regardless of what an earlier
# hedge phrase in the same response says.

# CODEX_NEGATION_WORDS (below) is kept — CODEX_MERGE_REFUSAL_PATTERN, part

# and finally wouldn't — fresh evidence from PR #1490 finding 3799391883
# — prompted this sweep rather than continuing to fix them one at a
# time). "did not"/"didn't" is DELIBERATELY excluded despite being an
# equally common negation form: "didn't find any major issues" is itself
# a clean-signal phrase, not something to negate, so folding bare
# "didn.t" into this list would make CODEX_MERGE_REFUSAL_PATTERN below
# false-positive-match a genuinely clean, unpunctuated sentence like
# "Codex didn't find any major issues that would block this from being
# merged." (the "didn't" and "merge" fall in the same clause, with no
# sentence terminator or comma between them to stop the match). This
# exclusion originally protected the now-deleted negated-approval
# pattern (issue #1491's implementation plan, Decision 2: the
# open-ended approval/negated-approval vocabulary this constant used to
# feed was replaced by codex_response_is_approved's whole-body
# exact-template match) — it is kept here because CODEX_NEGATION_WORDS'
# one remaining consumer, CODEX_MERGE_REFUSAL_PATTERN, has the exact
# same "didn't find any major issues" adjacency risk. Caught and

# `No blocking issues found. The tests correctly cover the "must fix"
# marker.` — and CODEX_APPROVAL_PATTERN, CODEX_NEGATED_APPROVAL_PATTERN,
# and CODEX_BLOCKING_PATTERN's substring matches can't distinguish
# quotation/discussion of a phrase from an assertion of it (fresh
# evidence from PR #1490 findings 3790122058 and 3793219190 —
# straight-quote and backtick-quote versions of the approval gap —
# 3793219192, which found that only the POSITIVE check was quote-stripped
# and a quoted REJECTION phrase still tripped the NEGATION check on the
# unstripped body — and 3793367887, which found that
# codex_response_is_blocking wasn't quote-stripped at all, so a quoted
# blocker token in an otherwise clean review still rejected it). Also
# strips GitHub-flavored Markdown blockquote LINES (a line starting with
# `>`, optionally indented): a review discussing a quoted clean phrase via
# blockquote syntax rather than straight/backtick quotes was likewise
# unprotected (fresh evidence from PR #1490 finding 3793367885). Also
# strips single-quoted spans ('...') — the fourth quoting style found
# unprotected after straight-quote, backtick, and blockquote (fresh
# evidence from PR #1490 finding 3793410331). Single quotes need a
# stricter boundary than the other three styles: a bare `'[^']*'` would
# also match the space between two UNRELATED apostrophes in contractions
# (e.g. "isn't approved, but it's fine" — a naive strip would treat the
# apostrophe in "isn't" and the apostrophe in "it's" as an opening/closing
# pair and delete everything between them, including "approved"). The
# opening quote is required to be preceded by whitespace-or-start-of-line
# and the closing quote by whitespace/punctuation-or-end, which a
# contraction's apostrophe never satisfies (the letters on both sides of
# it are word characters, not whitespace), so genuine quotation is
# distinguished from an apostrophe embedded in a word.
#
# Fenced Markdown code blocks (```...``` or ~~~...~~~) are deliberately
# NOT precisely parsed here, unlike the single-line constructs above.
# Four consecutive rounds of chasing GitHub-flavored Markdown's fence
# semantics — detecting a fence at all, tracking the opening delimiter's
# LENGTH (a longer outer fence can safely contain a shorter inner one),
# requiring a closing delimiter to be followed by nothing but whitespace,
# and finally discovering GFM's entirely separate TILDE-delimited fence
# syntax that a backtick-only implementation missed altogether — kept
# producing one more undiscovered edge case each round (PR #1490 findings
# 3793453010, 3793497787, a closing-validity followup, and 3795661290).
# Rather than continue precisely re-implementing GFM's fence grammar one
# construct at a time, codex_response_has_fence_marker above (used by
# codex_response_is_usage_limit and codex_response_is_environment_error;
# no longer by codex_response_is_approved as of issue #1491's
# conservative-verdict-classifier redesign, Decision 1) now treats the
# mere PRESENCE of a fence-opener marker (3+ consecutive backticks or
# tildes) ANYWHERE in the response as disqualifying, without attempting
# to determine where it opens or closes. This is a deliberate, explicit
# tradeoff: a small amount of
# false-NEEDS_REVISION risk (a genuinely clean response that happens to
# include an example code fence) in exchange for closing the entire class
# of "quoted/fenced clean phrase misread as an assertion" bug in one
# step, rather than the
# previous direction of chasing precision at the cost of repeated
# false-APPROVED gaps. Single/inline backticks (a PAIR on one line, not a
# 3+-run) are unaffected by this and still get the precise, stable
# stripping below — only multi-backtick/tilde FENCE markers trigger the
# conservative bail-out, since inline code references (e.g. `` `foo.py` ``)
# are extremely common in genuinely clean review comments and haven't

# implementation plan, Decisions 1 and 5): a prior design truncated the
# body at the footer's opening line and matched only the visible
# portion, trusting every byte after that line, unseen; a body reading
# the approved template + the footer's opening line only + an actual
# instruction (e.g. "Rename the unsafe function.") matched the visible
# portion exactly and would have been misclassified APPROVED under that
# design. There is no discarded byte range left for that construction
# (or any construction) to hide in — the entire body, first character to
# last, must be part of this one literal.
#
# This template has exactly TWO bounded placeholders, both anchored at a
# fixed position between exact literal text on either side, never a
# general wildcard:
#
# 1. The commit SHA, bound to git's own documented abbreviated-to-full
#    SHA-1 hex-length range (`[0-9a-f]{7,40}`) — NOT to the single
#    length any one capture happens to show.
# 2. The "flavor" slot immediately after "Didn't find any major issues. "
#    — see the dedicated comment block below for its full history and
#    bound derivation (issue #1491's implementation plan, Decision 2
#    Addendum).
#
# No other field is a placeholder, anywhere in the verdict sentence or
# the footer. Extending either placeholder's bound, or adding a whole new
# template, requires a live capture of the new evidence and the same
# review discipline the deleted CODEX_APPROVAL_PATTERN once required —
# these are the ONLY levers that can widen the approval surface, and
# reintroducing any truncation step before matching is explicitly
# forbidden (Decision 2/5).
#
# The footer portion of this literal was verified byte-identical (modulo
# one API-transport-only trailing newline that whitespace normalization
# already absorbs) across every real capture available at implementation
# time — the PR #1489 root-comment capture and every PR #1490/#1492
# review-body capture — so it contributes zero placeholders of its own.
#
# The apostrophe in "Didn't" is a literal straight ASCII apostrophe, NOT
# a regex wildcard — do not replace it with `.` if this pattern is
# edited; a wildcard there would silently widen the match to any
# character, which is exactly the kind of unreviewed widening this
# design forbids.
#
# The "flavor" slot's placeholder, `[^*`[:cntrl:]]{1,40}`, and why it
# replaced a 14-token literal alternation (issue #1491's implementation
# plan, Decision 2 second addendum — supersedes the first addendum's
# enumeration approach):
#
# History: this template originally hardcoded the single literal
# "Swish!" here. This repository's own PR #1494 falsified that
# assumption on its first real-traffic exercise — its Codex review used
# ":rocket:" instead and safe-failed. A repository-history sweep then
# found 14 distinct evidenced tokens, not the 1-2 anticipated — single
# words, full sentences, GitHub emoji shortcodes, inconsistent trailing
# punctuation. That diversity, discovered from fewer than 50 samples, is
# LLM-generated variety, not a fixed vocabulary: enumerating it would not
# converge, reopening issue #1491's original complaint (an open-ended
# enumeration that keeps finding one more case) on a new axis, just as
# every disqualifier/vocabulary design earlier in this plan's history
# already failed to converge for the same structural reason. Attempting a
# 14-token alternation shipped briefly, then was replaced by this bounded
# placeholder before merge, once that pattern became clear.
#
# Bound derivation: `{1,40}` — 40 is the longest evidenced token's length
# (31 characters, "More of your lovely PRs please.") rounded up to the
# nearest 10 with modest headroom, wide enough to admit a somewhat longer
# genuine flavor phrase without being large enough to admit multi-sentence
# injected content. `[^*`[:cntrl:]]` excludes only the characters that
# could let this slot swallow adjacent template structure: `*` (protects
# the literal `**Reviewed commit:**` bold-marker syntax immediately
# after this slot), backtick (protects the backtick-delimited SHA field
# that follows), and every control character including newline/carriage
# return (defense in depth — whitespace normalization, Decision 1,
# already guarantees no raw control character survives to this point,
# but the exclusion is kept explicit rather than relying solely on that
# guarantee). No apostrophe, colon, comma, period, exclamation mark, or
# plain space is excluded — every one of those appears in at least one
# evidenced token and the slot must keep admitting ordinary punctuation.
#
# Residual risk, stated plainly rather than claimed away: this is now a
# genuine (bounded) placeholder, not a literal — a false `APPROVED` is
# possible if Codex ever asserts "Didn't find any major issues." and then
# places an actual directive inside this 40-character slot while still
# reproducing the exact, complete footer verbatim afterward. This
# requires self-contradictory vendor output (a clean verdict immediately
# followed by an instruction, inside one otherwise-genuine response) and
# is treated as an accepted, disclosed trade — see Decision 2 second
# addendum and Risks & Mitigations for the full accounting — not a zero-
# risk claim.

#       what else the response says (e.g. "No blocking issues found.
#       Must fix ..." is blocking, not approved).
#   2 — unrecognized format: neither blocking, usage-limit, nor approved.
#       The documented verdict classifier safe-fails this to
#       NEEDS_REVISION (see "Verdict parsing" header comment) because it
#       could be a disguised rejection in an unexpected format. Ranked
#       ABOVE usage-limit: a permissive unavailable-policy consumer could
#       treat a usage-limit UNAVAILABLE more leniently than an explicit
#       NEEDS_REVISION, so an ambiguous response must not be silently
#       demoted behind a mere availability notice (fresh evidence from PR
#       #1490 finding 3789597796).
#   1 — usage-limit / environment error: two distinct "review was
#       unavailable" notices, ranked at the same lower availability tier.
#       Codex hit its review quota, OR the repo has no Codex environment
#       configured. A response containing both an approval phrase and
#       usage-limit wording (e.g. "No blocking issues could be evaluated
#       because you have reached your Codex usage limits") is a
#       usage-limit notice, not approved (fresh evidence from PR #1490
#       finding 3789555934). An ancillary environment-setup-error comment
#       must rank here too, not at the unrecognized-format tier: tied
#       against a genuine (if unrecognized-format) review, an
#       environment-setup error is a weaker, merely-informational
#       availability notice and must not silently replace the review's
#       safe-fail NEEDS_REVISION with an UNAVAILABLE-style
#       codex-github-environment-missing verdict (fresh evidence from PR
#       #1490 finding 3789722821).
#   0 — clean approval: the only tier that produces APPROVED.
#
# A single binary requires-attention flag is not enough: two tied
# responses that are BOTH "not a clean approval" (e.g. a usage-limit root
# comment and a blocking submitted review, or a usage-limit response and
# an unrecognized-format response) need their own internal ranking, not

# comment still updates it, keeping the most recent one. A SHA-pinned
# TERMINAL comment is never classified as either an environment error or a

    # ── Verdict parsing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Three-path classification (per spec BR-4 and implementation plan risk table).
    # Blocking markers are checked FIRST (safe-fail: a false NEEDS_REVISION that
    # triggers an unnecessary fix cycle is safer than a false APPROVED that
    # silently ignores blocking findings). The bare word "blocking" is excluded
    # because it is too broad; the phrases below are more targeted.
    #
    # 1. Blocking markers present → NEEDS_REVISION (exit 1)      [checked first]
    #    Blocking markers (case-insensitive): "changes requested",
    #    "blocking issues:" (colon required to distinguish from "no blocking issues
    #    found"), "blocking finding", "blocking:", "must fix", "action required",
    #    "required:", "❌"
    #
    # 2. Whole-body exact template match → APPROVED (exit 0)   [checked second,
    #    terminal (source == "review") evidence only]
    #    The entire, untruncated response body — whitespace-normalized,
    #    nothing truncated or discarded — must reproduce one of the
    #    templates in CODEX_APPROVED_TEMPLATES exactly (see
    #    codex_response_is_approved above and issue #1491's implementation
    #    plan, Decisions 1/2/5). There is no vocabulary list, no grammar,
    #    and no punctuation/case tolerance. Other Codex root PR comments
    #    and thumbs-up reactions are unavailable, not clean.
    #
    # 3. Neither found, and evidence is terminal → NEEDS_REVISION (exit 1)
    #    Safe-fail: default to NEEDS_REVISION when a terminal response's
    #    format is unrecognized, to avoid incorrectly approving a response
    #    that is a rejection in an unexpected format (per spec risk
    #    mitigation for BR-4). The acknowledgement branch immediately below
    #    is gated on the evidence being NON-terminal (source != "review",
    #    issue #1491's implementation plan, Decision 6), so a
    #    footer-bearing near-miss on terminal evidence always reaches this
    #    safe-fail rather than being misrouted to a wait/timeout.
    #
    # Note on "blocking issues" disambiguation: the phrase "blocking issues" appears
    # in both blocking context ("blocking issues: 1. foo") and clean context ("no
    # blocking issues found"). Requiring a colon after "issues" targets the blocking
    # list form while leaving the clean form to match the APPROVED branch via
    # "no blocking issues". This avoids false positives without line-level filtering
    # (which would risk missing a genuine marker on the same line as a negation).
