#!/usr/bin/env bash
# pr-ownership-guard.sh - refuse a PR mutation by number unless the PR belongs
# to the expected branch (issue #1444).
#
# `gh pr edit <n>`, `gh pr comment <n>`, `gh pr ready <n>`, and label changes by
# number accept any PR number. Under parallel waves a transposed digit, or a
# body file a sibling agent overwrote, silently mutates a sibling's PR. Run
# this guard immediately before every PR mutation that addresses the PR by
# number; proceed only on exit 0.
#
# Ownership is the head branch AND the head repository: a fork PR can carry an
# identically named branch, so a cross-repository PR is refused unless the
# caller names the fork with --expected-head-repo.
#
# The guard is read-only: it performs one `gh pr view` and never mutates the
# PR, the checkout, or the tracker.

Usage: pr-ownership-guard.sh --pr <number> [--expected-branch <branch>] \
  [--expected-head-repo <owner/name>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--repo-root <path>]

Resolves the PR's head branch and head repository and exits 0 only when both
match. Run it before any `gh pr edit|comment|ready|close` or label change that
addresses a PR by number.

Options:
  --pr <number>              PR number about to be mutated (required)
  --expected-branch <branch> Branch the PR must belong to. Default: the branch
                             currently checked out in --repo-root.
  --expected-head-repo <owner/name>
                             Repository the PR head must live in. Default: the
                             PR's own (base) repository, so any
                             cross-repository (fork) PR is refused, and a
                             same-repository PR's head must equal the target
                             repository (--repo, else GH_REPO, else the
                             --repo-root checkout's GitHub origin) when known.
  --repo <owner/name>        Passed through to `gh pr view --repo`.
  --repo-root <path>         Checkout whose branch is the default expectation.
                             Default: the current directory.
  -h, --help                 Show this help.

Environment:
  PR_OWNERSHIP_GUARD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  Deadline for the gh lookup (default 30).

Output (stdout, key=value): RESULT, PR, EXPECTED_BRANCH,
EXPECTED_BRANCH_SOURCE, PR_HEAD_BRANCH, PR_HEAD_REPO, PR_IS_CROSS_REPOSITORY,
EXPECTED_HEAD_REPO, MISMATCH (branch|head_repository, on not_owned), and
REQUIRED_ACTION on refusal.

Exit codes:
  0  RESULT=owned          PR head branch equals the expected branch; proceed.
  1  RESULT=not_owned      PR belongs to another branch or head repository;
                           do not mutate it.
  2  usage error.
  3  RESULT=pr_unresolved  gh or jq missing, gh failed or timed out, or the
                           response lacks the head branch, the
                           cross-repository flag, or a valid head repository
                           (owner/name); fail closed.
  4  RESULT=branch_unknown No --expected-branch and the checkout is detached
                           or its branch cannot be read; fail closed.
