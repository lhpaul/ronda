# check-tracker-merge-mapping.sh — AC-9 verification script
#
# Verifies that .github/workflows/update-tracker-on-merge.yml maps each supported
# branch prefix to the correct tracker status. Exits non-zero if any mapping is
# incorrect or missing.
#
# Required YAML structure (the "Detect branch type" step in the update-tracker job):
#   if [[ "$BRANCH" == spec/* ]];              → TARGET_STATUS="Spec Ready"
#   elif [[ "$BRANCH" == implementation-plan/* → TARGET_STATUS="Plan Ready"
#   elif [[ "$BRANCH" == feature/* || ...      → TARGET_STATUS="Merged"
#     (covers feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*, hotfix/*)
#   elif [[ "$BRANCH" == develop-* ]];         → BRANCH_TYPE="graduation"
#     (invokes graduation-closeout-from-merged-pr.sh closeout fallback)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/development-workflow/check-tracker-merge-mapping.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all six required mappings are correct and graduation fallback is wired
#   1 — one or more mappings are incorrect or missing
