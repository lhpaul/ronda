# A consumer added later is caught by the Part 2 scan on the next run that
# selects this suite (any workflow-lib.sh change, or the scheduled full run).
#
# GitHub's statusCheckRollup keeps superseded runs: PR #1547 carried
# `policy failure 05:26:31` and `policy success 05:28:16` for one SHA. A scan
# over the raw rollup reports a failure that is no longer true.
#
#   Part 1 — the shared jq definition (AC-2, AC-3, and its edge rules).
#   Part 2 — the inventory: every script that reads the rollup (or REST
#            check-runs) routes it through the shared definition (AC-1), and
#            no script outside
#            workflow-lib.sh carries its own copy of the grouping (AC-4). This
#            is what keeps a NEW consumer from silently scanning the raw rollup.
#   Part 3 — discover-workflow-state.sh, the one list-view consumer, end to end.
#   Part 4 — Protocol 91 Step 8a Check 0, the readiness gate's own CI count,
#            extracted from the protocol and executed against REST check-run
#            pages (the REST endpoint keeps superseded runs as well).
#
# The other consumers are exercised end to end in their own suites:
# test-pr-ci-loop.sh, test-run-epic-risk-classifier.sh,
# test-run-epic-delegated-gate.sh, test-item-completion-self-check.sh,
# test-batch-merge-recheck-remaining.sh.
