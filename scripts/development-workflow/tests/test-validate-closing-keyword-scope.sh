# test-validate-closing-keyword-scope.sh — cross-PR closing-keyword validation
# (issue #1644).
# covers: scripts/development-workflow/validate-closing-keyword-scope.sh
# covers: scripts/development-workflow/closing-keyword-lib.sh
# covers: scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh
# covers: .github/workflows/closing-keyword-scope.yml
#
# Three kinds of assertion live here, and the difference matters:
#
#   * BEHAVIOUR — the library and the validator's decision logic, exercised
#     directly against stubbed `gh`.
#   * PARITY — the extracted filter must produce byte-identical output to the
#     one post-merge cleanup uses. A reimplementation would be correct on the
#     day it was written and wrong at the first change to either side.
#   * STRUCTURE — assertions on the text of the workflow file. The guards they
#     protect cannot be exercised from a test runner: a fork event cannot be
#     synthesized locally, and GitHub loads pull_request_target workflows from
#     the default branch, so nothing here can make the workflow run. A silently
#     dropped `if:` is exactly the regression that would otherwise ship.
