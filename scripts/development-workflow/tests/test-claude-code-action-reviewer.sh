# test-claude-code-action-reviewer.sh — Unit tests for the run-poll jq filter
# logic in claude-code-action-reviewer.sh.
#
# Tests verify that the run-name PR-scoped filter (post-#806/#808 fix) selects
# the correct run from the GitHub Actions Runs API response. Area 3 verifies
# that inputs.pr_number (always null in the API) is not referenced. Areas 5+
# verify the run-name PR-scoping mechanism required for concurrent dispatch:
# under parallel batches, two PRs may dispatch claude-code-review.yml within
# the same poll window; the run-name filter ensures only the run for THIS PR
# is selected, not the most-recent run regardless of which PR triggered it.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-claude-code-action-reviewer.sh
# Requires: bash, jq
# Exit code: 0 if all tests pass, 1 if any test fails.
