# select-test-suites.sh — resolve which workflow test suites a change set needs.
#
# Issue #1537: CI previously ran a hard-coded list of six suites behind a path
# filter, so a PR that changed any other workflow script showed a fully green
# check rollup while its own suite never executed. This script replaces the
# hard-coded list with a mapping derived from the repository itself, so a newly
# added suite is wired up the moment it lands (AC-2).
#
# ── How a suite declares what it covers ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. Self-declaration (authoritative). A suite may declare the paths it
#    exercises with `# covers:` header lines within its first
#    COVERS_HEADER_LINES lines:
#
#        # covers: scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh
#        # covers: docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/94-*.md
#
#    Multiple lines accumulate, and one line may list several space-separated
#    patterns. The declaration lives next to the test rather than in a central
#    map, so it cannot drift out of sync with a file it no longer describes.
#
# 2. Naming convention (default). A suite with no `# covers:` header covers
#    scripts/development-workflow/<name>.sh and <name>.py for a suite named
#    test-<name>.sh. That covers most suites; the ones testing protocols, docs,
#    or cross-cutting hub contracts rather than one script need the header.
#
# In both cases a suite always covers its own file and its own fixture
# directory, so editing a test runs it.
#
# ── Pattern syntax ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Patterns are repository-root-relative and glob-like, matched precisely rather
# than by shell `case` semantics:
#
#     **  matches any characters, including '/'
#     *   matches any characters except '/'
#     ?   matches a single character except '/'
#
# So 'scripts/development-workflow/hub-*.sh' matches hub-status.sh but NOT
# tests/hub-thing.sh, and 'docs/workflow/**' matches at any depth below it.
#
# ── Usage ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   select-test-suites.sh --changed-files <path>   # '-' reads stdin
#   select-test-suites.sh --all
#   select-test-suites.sh --all --shards 8
#   select-test-suites.sh --report-gaps
#   select-test-suites.sh --print-map
#
# Options:
#   --changed-files <path>  File with one changed repo-relative path per line.
#                           Emits the suites that change set requires.
#   --all                   Emit every suite (the scheduled full run).
#   --shards <n>            Group the selected suites into at most <n> shards
#                           instead of emitting them individually, so CI can
#                           run one job per shard rather than one job per
#                           suite. See "Sharding" below. Requires --all or
#                           --changed-files.
#   --report-gaps           Emit the coverage-gap report (AC-3): workflow
#                           scripts with no suite, and suites that no PR change
#                           set can select. Always exits 0 — the report is
#                           visibility, not a gate.
#   --print-map             Emit 'suite<TAB>pattern' for each resolved mapping.
#   --format <lines|json>   Output format for suite lists. Default 'lines'.
#
# ── Sharding ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# GitHub bills every job rounded UP to a whole minute, and most suites here
# finish in seconds, so one job per suite bills several times the compute it
# uses. --shards packs the selection into at most <n> groups that each run
# sequentially in one job.
#
# Packing is longest-processing-time-first: suites are sorted longest-first and
# each is placed in the shard with the least work so far. That keeps the
# slowest shard — and therefore the wall-clock time of the whole run — close to
# the theoretical minimum, which is what stops the cheaper billing from costing
# latency. The BILL is roughly independent of how well the packing balances
# (it is the total work plus one rounding penalty per shard); the WALL TIME is
# not, which is why the packing is worth doing properly.
#
# A suite's expected duration comes from a '# duration: <seconds>' header line,
# read from the same bounded header window as '# covers:'. A suite that does
# not declare one is assumed to take DEFAULT_SUITE_SECONDS. Only suites that
# run materially longer than that need a header — the default is deliberately
# close to the median so an undeclared suite cannot distort the packing much,
# and a stale hint costs balance, never correctness.
#
# ── Output ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Without --shards
#   lines: repo-relative suite paths, one per line, sorted.
#   json:  ["suite", ...]
#
# With --shards <n>
#   lines: one shard per line, '<id><TAB><space-joined suites>'.
#   json:  [{"id":"1/8","suites":"a b c","timeout_minutes":38}, ...] —
#          shaped for a GitHub Actions matrix, where each element becomes one
#          job, 'id' names it, and 'timeout_minutes' gives that shard enough
#          budget for every suite to reach its own per-suite cap plus the
#          timeout command's kill-after grace.
#
# Fewer suites than shards yields fewer shards; an empty selection yields no
# shards at all ('[]' in json), so the caller can skip the test job entirely.
#
# Exit codes: 0 success, 2 usage error.
#
# Portability: written for bash 3.2 (the macOS system bash) — no mapfile,
# readarray, or associative arrays — because agents run this locally as well as
# in CI.
