#
# validate-closing-keyword-scope.sh — warn when a pull request declares a
# closing keyword for an issue a sibling pull request is carrying.
#
# Every rule lives here rather than in the workflow YAML, so the logic is
# testable without GitHub. The workflow is routing.
#
# Usage:
#   validate-closing-keyword-scope.sh <pr_number> <owner/repo> [--publish]
#                                     [--sibling-list-unreadable]
#
# Without --publish the run computes its verdict, prints it, and writes
# nothing. Publication additionally requires the serialized workflow context
# (see require_publication_context) — a flag alone is a convention, not a
# guard, and the ordering guarantee rests on every writer being inside the
# target-keyed concurrency group.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  verdict computed (and published, when publishing was requested and the
#      freshness re-read agreed)
#   1  publication was requested from outside the serialized context, or an
#      argument was invalid
#   2  a gate input could not be read AND the indeterminate outcome could not
#      itself be published

# Which references the description contributes
#
# The closer this pull request will meet decides how the text is filtered:
# merging to the default branch, the platform closes from the description
# alone; merging anywhere else, this repository's own cleanup reads title and
# description as one text, so a fence opened in the title suppresses what
# follows it in the description.
#
# In the concatenated case, attribution is differential rather than
# positional. A first pass filters `title + "\n" + description`; a second
# filters the same text with every closing-keyword token in the DESCRIPTION
# mangled length-preservingly. The reported set is the multiset difference.
#
# Multiset, not set: when the title and description both name issue 12 and
# both are live, 12 appears twice in the first pass and once in the second,
# and the difference correctly yields one description-contributed reference.
#
# An earlier design put a sentinel line between title and description and
# reported what followed it. A title that opens a fence which the description
# CLOSES part-way through, before a later live `Closes #12`, breaks it: the
# sentinel is inside the fence and filtered away, the keyword after the
# closing fence is not, and the run would have gone silent on a reference the
# closer will act on. Differential filtering never reasons about position; it
# asks the filter itself, twice, over structurally identical text.

# Ownership
#
# There is exactly one ownership signal: an implementation branch whose name

# pull request that wrongly claimed an issue would be linked to it BECAUSE of
# that claim, read as the issue's owner, and suppress the warning it was
# supposed to produce.
#
# Spec and plan branches are never owners: they carry documentation for an
# issue, not the work that closes it.

# every lowercase team-prefixed sibling invisible, which is the spec's stated
# reason for reading the form at all: "the warning would go silent on precisely
# the mistake it exists to catch".
#
# The cost is real and the spec accepts it. A descriptive slug that happens to
# start `<word>-<number>-` — `fix/retro-517-doc-gaps` — is indistinguishable in
