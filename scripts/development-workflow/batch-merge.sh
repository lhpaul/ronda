# batch-merge.sh — Deterministic merge pipeline for parallel batch PRs.
#
# Handles PR discovery (auto or explicit), metadata collection, merge ordering,
# and single-PR merge execution with structured key-value output.  The agent
# protocol (94-batch-merge-protocol.md) drives the human-interaction loop and
# calls this script once per PR in the approved merge order.
#
# Usage:
#   # --- Discovery mode ---
#   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] discover
#   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] discover --prs 101,102,103
#   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] discover --include-checkpointed --prs 101,102,103
#
#   # --- Per-PR merge mode ---
#   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] merge --pr 101 --expected-head-sha <sha>
#
#   # --- Safe branch deletion (MERGED-state guard) ---
#   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] delete-branch --pr 101
#
#   --base defaults to 'develop'; override to merge into an epic integration branch.

# If `gh pr merge` fails and the PR is not yet MERGED, a warning is emitted

#   ERROR_MESSAGE=<text>                 (when DELETE_RESULT=skipped; covers non-MERGED state and push failures)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — operation succeeded (clean merge, discovery complete, branch deleted/not_found, or branch deletion safely skipped — e.g. PR not yet MERGED)
#   1  — conflict detected (caller must classify and resolve)

Usage:
  batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] discover [--include-checkpointed] [--prs <num1,num2,...>]
  batch-merge.sh recheck-remaining --prs <num1,num2,...> --after-merged-pr <number> --base <branch> [--approved-unready-prs <num1,num2,...>] [--reviewed-head-shas <num>:<sha>,...] [--annotate]
          --after-merged-pr must itself be one of the numbers listed in --prs
          (the frozen in-scope list). Passing a merged PR that is absent from
          --prs exits with reason=after_merged_pr_not_in_frozen_list.
          --reviewed-head-shas (one entry per remaining PR; a partial map is
          refused with reason=reviewed_head_sha_missing) binds each remaining PR to the headRefOid its
          reviewer-loop / CI / risk verdicts were produced at (discover emits
          it as PR_HEAD_SHA). A PR whose live head differs is reported
          classification=merge_blocked reason=head_sha_changed with
          verdicts_voided listing what the new head invalidates (#1558) —
          even when its merge state is CLEAN. If the live head cannot be read
          at all, reason=head_sha_unavailable carries the same
          verdicts_voided and required_action=reverify_at_current_head —
          an unreadable head must not be read as "nothing to re-verify".
          --annotate writes (or updates in place) a <!-- batch-merge-hold:v1 -->
          comment on every PR held by a sibling's effect (head_sha_changed,
          head_sha_unavailable, merge_state_non_clean, checks_failed) so the
          hold reason, the invalidating sibling, and the re-verification
          requirement are on the PR itself; label and draft holds are not
          annotated. A PR that rechecks clean gets its hold comment marked
          lifted (annotation=lifted, or none when it never had one).
          Every record carries head_sha, reviewed_head_sha, verdicts_voided,
          required_action, and (with --annotate) annotation.
  batch-merge.sh annotate-hold --pr <number> --reason <text> [--held-by <who>] [--invalidating-sibling <number>] [--head-sha <sha>]
          Record a hold on the PR itself (same marker comment as --annotate)
          when a PR is held outside a recheck — a risk-guardrail hold, a
          human hold. A held PR is not a parked PR: it stays in the frozen
          recheck list and gets the same conflict maintenance (#1558).
  batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] merge --pr <number> --expected-head-sha <sha>
  batch-merge.sh [--base <branch>] delete-branch --pr <number>

  --base  Target integration branch (default: develop).
          Override when merging PRs into an epic integration branch.

  --include-checkpointed
          Discovery only. Include PRs labeled human-checkpoint-required in the
          candidate output after protocol-level confirmation. Merge mode still
          refuses that label until checkpoint satisfaction evidence removes it.

#
# Returns 0 (true) when the newline-separated <haystack> contains a line
# exactly equal to <needle>, 1 otherwise.
#
# Why this exists instead of `producer | grep -q needle`: under
# `set -o pipefail` (enabled at the top of this script), a `cmd | grep -q`
# pipeline is racy. `grep -q` exits as soon as it finds its first match,
# closing its stdin (the pipe's read end) while `cmd` may still be writing
# more output. That kills `cmd` with SIGPIPE, so `cmd` itself exits non-zero
# (128+SIGPIPE) even though it did nothing wrong and `grep` genuinely found a
# match. Bash's pipefail exit-status rule ("last command, scanning
# right-to-left, to exit non-zero") then reports the *pipeline* as failed —
# even though grep's own exit status was 0 (match found) — because it finds
# `cmd`'s non-zero SIGPIPE exit before it finds grep's exit. The failure is
# therefore data- and timing-dependent: it only reproduces when `cmd` still
# has buffered output left to write at the moment `grep -q` finds its match,
# which is why the bug in #1516 was intermittent rather than deterministic.
#
# The fix here is to never let a downstream consumer's early exit signal an
# upstream producer at all: capture the producer's full output into a plain
# bash variable first (a `$(...)` command substitution always drains its
# command to completion — nothing downstream can close its pipe early), then
# match against that variable with pure bash string comparison (`case`, no
# subprocess, no pipe, nothing to SIGPIPE). Because there is no pipe on the
# matching side, this construction cannot reintroduce the race regardless of
# how large the haystack is or how early the needle appears in it.
#
# Constraint: <needle> must not itself contain a literal newline, or the
# `$'\n'"$needle"$'\n'` pattern would need an embedded newline in the exact
# position the haystack's line separators appear, which the glob match above
# does not attempt to satisfy. Every call site passes a hardcoded, newline-
# free literal (a label name or "CHANGELOG.md"), so this is a documented
# caller contract, not a runtime check.
