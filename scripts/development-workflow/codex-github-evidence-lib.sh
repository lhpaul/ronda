# codex-github-evidence-lib.sh — shared Codex GitHub review-thread evidence
# helpers, sourced by both codex-github-reviewer.sh (the companion

#
# #1757: "Resolved Codex findings no longer block reviewer loop." This
# library exists so both callers use exactly one implementation of
# applicability-aware Codex review-thread counting, rather than two
# implementations that could silently diverge.
#
# Rules for this file (must remain safe to `source` under `set -euo pipefail`
# from either caller):
#   - No top-level side effects (no argument parsing, no `exit`).
#   - Every function takes its inputs as explicit parameters — no reads of
#     caller-specific globals (companion globals such as $OWNER/$REPO or loop
#     locals such as $repo/$graphql_bot_login must never be read here).
#   - Every function's contract (parameters, stdout shape, return codes) is
#     documented directly above it.

#                             Addressed" in the first comment). A resolved
#                             Codex finding is excluded here regardless of
#                             applicability, per #1757 spec Business Rule 2

#   - inapplicable          : not cleared, but the thread's owning review is
#                             DISMISSED, or that review's commit does not
#                             equal the live head. Excluded from both
#                             buckets below (neither a current blocker nor

#                             "A conversation is applicable only when its
#                             Codex review is current and not dismissed and

#                             pull-request revision." When the owning
#                             review's commit cannot be read at all, the
#                             thread is treated as applicable (fails closed
#                             toward still counting as a blocker, never
#                             toward silently clearing one).
#   - "strict_unresolved"   : not cleared, and applicable. No relaxation is
#                             ever applied to this field regardless of mode.
#   - "provisional_relaxed" : the subset of strict_unresolved threads whose
#                             LAST comment was authored by a non-bot after
#                             the PR's current head-commit committedDate

#     alone. Never read provisional_relaxed there.

# #1757 follow-up (Cursor Bugbot finding on PR #1780, "CHANGES_REQUESTED
# remapped to wait"): codex_review_thread_evidence_counts above counts only
# INLINE REVIEW THREADS. A submitted Codex review whose GitHub review state
# is CHANGES_REQUESTED is itself an actionable blocker per spec Business
# Rules 5/6, even when it carries no inline thread at all (a body-only
# review) or when every one of its own inline threads is separately
# resolved — GitHub's structured request-for-changes state is not a thread
# and is never cleared by resolving conversations.
# codex_finalize_verdict's "cleared"/"none" branches (codex-github-
# reviewer.sh) already refuse to treat such a review as cleared for exactly
# this reason, but that refusal collapses to a bare exit code once the
# companion returns to its caller — pr-review-loop.sh's exit-1 recount
# cannot see WHY the companion said NEEDS_REVISION. Without this check, a
# zero-thread recount was silently remapped to waiting_on_reviewer even
# though the live head still carries an active CHANGES_REQUESTED verdict,
# discarding a genuine blocker. This function re-derives that fact directly
# from the live PR review state so the exit-1 recount can guard against it.
#
# stdout : "1" — a live-head, non-dismissed submitted review authored by
#                the bot (matching either the REST "[bot]"-suffixed login

#                CHANGES_REQUESTED, OR the live head SHA or the review list

#
# #1757 (AC-13, AC-14, spec Business Rule 9): the live-head evidence-window
# occupancy guard. A SHA can occupy a pull request's head position more than
# once (a revert, or a force-push back), and every such occupancy is its own
# evidence window (spec line 109: "every Codex root comment belongs to
# exactly one head's evidence window, because such a comment is not
# inherently revision-bound"). Returning the head to a previously current
# SHA can only happen via a force-update of the ref, which always emits a
# `head_ref_force_pushed` (or, for a delete/restore pair,
# `head_ref_deleted`/`head_ref_restored`) pull-request timeline event
# (Verification Log row "Force-push event payload"), so this function's one
# job is: does the timeline show the head moved after <trigger_time>, and if
# so, when.
#
# <trigger_time> is the caller's chosen anchor instant, not necessarily a
# real trigger: a TRIGGERED live-head call site (codex_refresh_occupancy_
# boundary_or_escalate) passes the created_at of the latest trigger naming
# the live head; the TRIGGER-LESS pre-check call site (codex_refresh_
# existing_occupancy_boundary_or_escalate, #1757 follow-up closing the
# reviewer-reproduced trigger-less gap) passes the pull request's own
# creation time instead, because that path runs before this run's first
# trigger exists and SHA reuse — which always requires a force-update of the
# ref — is exactly as possible before a first trigger as it is between two
# later ones. This function is a no-op when <trigger_time> is empty.
#
# Sets:
#   CODEX_OCCUPANCY_BOUNDARY_TIME       — the newest created_at, among
#     head_ref_force_pushed / head_ref_deleted / head_ref_restored timeline
#     events strictly newer than <trigger_time>, or empty when none exists
#     (or the guard is a no-op because <trigger_time> is empty). Deliberately
#     NOT filtered by the event's commit_id: in an A -> B -> A force-push
#     sequence, the FINAL force-push's commit_id equals the live head, and a
#     guard that skipped events naming the live head would miss exactly the
#     case it exists to catch (implementation plan: "Do not filter these
#     events by commit_id").
#   CODEX_OCCUPANCY_BOUNDARY_UNAVAILABLE — 1 when the timeline could not be
#     read after one retry, or a matching event's own created_at could not
#     be read from the payload; 0 otherwise. The caller must treat 1 as the
#     fail-closed "boundary unreadable" escalation
#     (evidence_unavailable_codex_thread_state) — never as "no event found".
#     A timeline read that fails or truncates after its retry is exactly
#     this case, per the implementation plan: "A timeline read that fails or
#     truncates after one retry is the boundary unreadable escalation
#     below, not a silent skip. If such an event is present but carries no
#     usable created_at, treat it the same way — escalate rather than
#     ignoring the event."
#
# Return: always 0. Failure is signaled via CODEX_OCCUPANCY_BOUNDARY_
# UNAVAILABLE, not the function's own exit status, so a caller under
# `set -euo pipefail` never needs an `if !` guard merely to read the flag.
