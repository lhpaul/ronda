description: Plan Ready stage. Use when an implementation plan needs to be written. For Full Pipeline items, a spec must be approved first. For Refactor items, the work item brief replaces the spec. Reads the codebase, resolves technical approach questions, then writes the implementation plan, runs its reviewer gate, and resolves PR readiness.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit, Bash

Follow the implementation plan generation protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md`

**BATCH_CONTEXT isolation self-check (read first when BATCH_CONTEXT=true)**:
Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation,
or tracker mutation, verify `isolation: "worktree"`, expected worktree path,
expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation
classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/`
and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop
before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch;
escalate for human inspection if mutation may already have occurred outside the
assigned worktree. All `Edit` and `Write` tool calls must target paths under the
resolved `<worktree-path>`.

For substantial or multi-part mutating plan work, commit immediately after each
completed logical sub-part so interrupted runs have a recoverable checkpoint.
Do not intentionally batch all completed sub-parts into one end-of-run commit,
and never commit incomplete, failing, or incoherent edits only to satisfy this
requirement.

## Repository Mode Context

Resolve repository mode and artifact owner before writing a plan. Missing mode
or `single_repo` means the current repository owns the plan. In `workflow_hub`,
plans and plan PRs are hub-owned on the hub artifact base branch, even when the
product implementation base is different. In `product_repo`, report the
configured hub owner or stop if ownership is ambiguous.

Before creating a plan branch or opening a plan PR for a tracker-backed item,
run `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh` with required `--mode`, `--issue`, `--expected-branch`, `--approved-base`, and the expected `implementation-plan/*`
branch and the approved artifact base. Stop on missing base, duplicate
artifacts, wrong-base PRs, or scan failures.

Keep implementation files off `implementation-plan/*` branches. Before plan PR
readiness, Protocol 91 Step 8a must run
`check-documentation-stage-alignment.sh`; a mismatch must be corrected or
escalated before `ready-for-human-review`.

That document is the single source of truth for this stage. Always read the approved spec (or the work item brief for Refactor items) and relevant codebase sections before proposing an approach. Once ambiguity is resolved, continue through reviewer gate, PR creation, and PR readiness unless the protocol requires human input.

Before any other step, run the Step 0 Template-Fit Check: read `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` and if `template.is_template` is `true`, evaluate whether the spec is generic enough for a framework template. If the spec references a framework-specific language or runtime not used by the template's own toolchain (e.g., React, Rails, Django), surface the structured warning from Step 0 of the protocol and halt until the human responds with one of the three options (confirm generic, narrow scope, or cancel). Do not write any plan content while this check is pending.

Before finalizing Step 3, classify parser-risk using the deterministic signals in protocol 02 (tooling-path parser/lint changes, parser/scanner-oriented module naming, or explicit regex/structured-text scanning behavior). When parser-risk applies, include the mandatory edge-case enumeration and unit-test mapping subsections before deep Layer-by-Layer walkthroughs. If suppressions are part of the feature, include suppression semantics (recognized directives, placement, and multi-suppression behavior).

Before finalizing Step 3, also classify concurrent-event-source using the deterministic signals in protocol 02 (two or more concurrent event listeners/socket callbacks/timers/async queues, shared mutable state across execution contexts, or initialization/teardown sequences that race with incoming events). When concurrent-event-source applies, include the mandatory concurrency safety checklist section with design decisions for each of the seven items.

Before finalizing Step 3, also check whether the plan introduces or modifies a cross-cutting checklist (a safety, quality, or compliance category that applies across multiple feature implementations). When cross-cutting checklist applies, enumerate ALL files that need updating — including the developer protocol, all agent/skill guidance files for tech-lead and developer roles, `REVIEW.md`, and any Codex skill files that invoke the affected stage. Run the live search defined in protocol 02's "Cross-cutting checklist plans" block before writing the enumeration. Do not list only the primary protocol file.

Every plan must include the `Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check` from
protocol 02. If the plan relies on an environment target, approved base,
artifact owner, linked resource, selected product repository, canonical
configuration value, or similar operational fact, record its value, source,
verification time, bounded current invocation / same-surface open PR scope, and result. Use
`Not applicable` only with a concise rationale; do not scan every open PR when
there is no applicable assumption. Shared keywords alone are not conflict
evidence. Return same-surface `Conflict` evidence to the parent orchestrator for
`Resolved` or `Human decision required` handling, and stop plan-stage
advancement until that resolution or decision is recorded.

When the spec language implies pattern-based completeness, follow protocol 02's live-search vs spec-frozen enumeration rules and include a reproducible Verification Log.

For sweep, batch, helper-extraction, numeric-target, or pattern-completeness
plans, name the residual verification strategy and evidence source the
implementation must produce before readiness.

Before committing in Step 5, run the cross-section consistency self-check and
Document Quality Gate defined in protocol 02. Check every item that appears more
than once across plan sections: function/method names, constant names, decision
index labels, file paths, directory names, and route/URL structures. For complex
workflow decision-gate plans, include protocol 02's matrix classification and
Document Quality Gate entry. Fix all inconsistencies before proceeding to the
lint check, and include the Document Quality Gate log in the draft PR
description.

Before writing or updating the smoke runbook (protocol 02 Step 4), discover
design assets per `docs/workflow/development-workflow/design-assets.md`. When
assets exist, include at least one expected-vs-actual fidelity step naming the
reference(s); when none exist, omit fidelity steps and do not invent a baseline.

Before updating tracker status as part of a standalone plan completion sequence, call `ensure_on_project_board <issue_number> "Writing Plan"` (from `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`) to register the issue on the project board if it is not already present.
