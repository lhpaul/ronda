description: Spec Ready stage. Use when a new feature needs a spec written. Conducts a structured alignment conversation with the human, then writes the feature spec, runs its reviewer gate, and resolves PR readiness. Do NOT use for bugs or simple changes (use the developer agent with fast track instead) or for refactors (use the tech-lead agent to write a plan directly).
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit, Bash

Follow the spec generation protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/01-generate-spec-protocol.md`

**BATCH_CONTEXT isolation self-check (read first when BATCH_CONTEXT=true)**:
Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation,
or tracker mutation, verify `isolation: "worktree"`, expected worktree path,
expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation
classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/`
and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop
before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch;
escalate for human inspection if mutation may already have occurred outside the
assigned worktree. All `Edit` and `Write` tool calls must target paths under the
resolved `<worktree-path>`.

For substantial or multi-part mutating spec work, commit immediately after each
completed logical sub-part so interrupted runs have a recoverable checkpoint.
Do not intentionally batch all completed sub-parts into one end-of-run commit,
and never commit incomplete, failing, or incoherent edits only to satisfy this
requirement.

## Repository Mode Context

Resolve repository mode and artifact owner before writing a spec. Missing mode
or `single_repo` means the current repository owns the spec. In `workflow_hub`,
specs and spec PRs are hub-owned on the hub artifact base branch, even when the
product implementation base is different. In `product_repo`, report the
configured hub owner or stop if ownership is ambiguous.

Before creating a spec branch or opening a spec PR for a tracker-backed item,
run `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh` with required `--mode`, `--issue`, `--expected-branch`, `--approved-base`, and the expected `spec/*` branch and the
approved artifact base. Stop on missing base, duplicate artifacts, wrong-base
PRs, or scan failures.

That document is the single source of truth for this stage. Do not skip the alignment conversation. Once ambiguity is resolved, continue through reviewer gate, PR creation, and PR readiness unless the protocol requires human input.

When the handoff includes output from
`scripts/development-workflow/spec-dispatch-context.sh`, read it before the
alignment conversation. Preserve confirmed decisions and non-blocking
relationship outcomes as product constraints. Do not turn helper mechanics,
token matching, JSON fields, or implementation algorithms into spec
requirements. If context is `blocking=true` or `Unclear`, stop for the named
human relationship decision.

Before opening the draft PR, complete protocol 01's Document Quality Gate and
include the gate log in the PR description. For tracker-backed items, follow
protocol 01's Brief Objective List, Coverage Matrix, and Deferral Note
requirements as part of that gate. For complex workflow decision-gate specs,
include protocol 01's consistency matrix or not-applicable rationale.

When creating the development folder, discover design assets per
`docs/workflow/development-workflow/design-assets.md`. If confirmed tracker
design assets exist, copy or download them into `<dev-folder>/assets/` and
update the issue-body location note. Do not invent assets when none exist.

Before updating tracker status as part of a standalone spec completion sequence, call `ensure_on_project_board <issue_number> "Writing Spec"` (from `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`) to register the issue on the project board if it is not already present.
