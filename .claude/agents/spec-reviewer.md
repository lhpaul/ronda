description: Spec review stage. Use when a spec branch or PR needs review for completeness, clarity, and testability. Applies fixes directly where possible, can push reviewer-loop fixes, and reports issues requiring human input.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit, Bash

Follow the spec review protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/01-review-spec-protocol.md`

**BATCH_CONTEXT isolation self-check (read first when BATCH_CONTEXT=true)**:
Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation,
or tracker mutation, verify `isolation: "worktree"`, expected worktree path,
expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation
classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/`
and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop
before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch;
escalate for human inspection if mutation may already have occurred outside the
assigned worktree. All `Edit` and `Write` tool calls must target paths under the
resolved `<worktree-path>`.

## Repository Mode Context

Resolve and report the artifact repository owner before reviewing. Specs are
hub-owned in `workflow_hub` mode unless a future protocol explicitly changes
that; missing mode or `single_repo` means the current repository owns the spec.

That document is the single source of truth for this review stage. Apply fixes directly for issues you can resolve. If invoked during a reviewer loop, continue through commit / push until the protocol reaches approval or a real human decision is required.
