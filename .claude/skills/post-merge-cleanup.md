description: >
  After a development PR is merged, sync with origin, switch to the merged PR's
  base branch, pull, verify or delete the remote implementation branch, delete the local branch,
  and update the related issue in the issue tracker.
  Usage: /post-merge-cleanup [--base base-branch] [--pr merged-pr-number] [branch-name]
---

Run the post-merge cleanup script from the repository root.

- **From repo root**, run:
  <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
  ```bash
  ./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh [--base base-branch] [--pr merged-pr-number] [branch-name]
  ```
- **No argument**: use the current branch (user should run while still on the merged branch).
- **With `branch-name`**: delete that local branch (e.g. `feature/my-feature`).
- **With `--base base-branch`**: explicitly choose the cleanup base branch. When omitted for hub-owned cleanup, the script queries the merged PR base and fails closed if that lookup is unavailable.
- **With `--pr merged-pr-number`**: bind implementation remote branch cleanup to the exact merged PR before deleting any remote branch. Required on implementation branches; the helper fail-fasts with exit 64 when this flag is missing.

The script will: fetch origin, checkout the merged PR's base branch, pull,
verify or delete the remote branch for implementation branches only after the
PR is confirmed merged, then delete the local branch with `git branch -D`
(force-delete; safe because the branch is already merged on the remote). If the
user is not in the repo root, change to the repo root first.

For implementation branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`),
cleanup is complete only when the script reports `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=deleted`
or `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=not_found`. Spec and implementation-plan branches are
expected-persistent remotely.

Do not skip steps or change the order. If the script fails, show the error and stop.

**After the script succeeds — update the issue tracker (if configured):**
The merged branch name often contains an issue identifier (e.g. `feature/ENG-123-user-auth` → `ENG-123`, or `feature/42-user-auth` → `#42`). If so, update that issue in the project’s issue tracker using the branch-type-based status table from Step 10 of `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`:

| Merged branch type                                | Set tracker status to |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `spec/*`                                          | Spec Ready            |
| `implementation-plan/*`                           | Plan Ready            |
| `feature/*` / `fix/*` / `refactor/*` / `hotfix/*` | Merged                |

If the item’s tracker status is already in a further-advanced state (e.g., already `In Development` when a spec branch merges), do not roll it back — leave it as-is.

For **Linear**, use the Linear MCP to set the issue status (see `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md`). For **GitHub Projects**, update the project item Status field via the `gh` CLI / GraphQL (see `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/github-projects.md`); only close the issue with `gh issue close` for implementation branches (feature/fix/refactor/hotfix), not for spec or plan branches. For other trackers, set the equivalent status; see `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/issue-tracker.md`. If the branch has no issue ID or no tracker is in use, skip this step.

**After cleanup and tracker update — suggest a retrospective if appropriate:**
If this post-merge cleanup is the final action for a work item that was advanced in the current session (i.e., you drove the item through implementation, review, and merge in this conversation), suggest running a retrospective:

> Would you like to run a retrospective on this session’s work?

Only suggest this when the cleanup is for a standalone item run (not when called as part of a batch merge or orchestrator flow, which handle retrospectives at their own level). See `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06-retrospective-protocol.md`.
