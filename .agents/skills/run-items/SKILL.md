# Run Items

This is the Codex command-style alias for Claude Code `/run-items`.

`/run-items` is the **bounded multi-item batch execute** command. It takes two or
more explicit item targets, validates the list with the read-only router, runs
the shared bounded prelude, and then executes through Protocol 90 in
`explicit_list` mode. PRs target `develop` directly without a portfolio scan or
proposal step.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide rules.
2. Run read-only router validation:
   `./scripts/development-workflow/run-work-router.sh <target> [<target>...] [--json]`.
   Continue only when the router returns `MODE=redirect_items` (or JSON
   `mode: "redirect_items"`). Stop with redirect guidance for `no_target_scan`,
   `redirect_item`, `redirect_epic`, or `ambiguous`.
3. Run the read-only bounded prelude:
   `./scripts/development-workflow/run-bounded-prelude.sh --original-command "<invocation>" --items "<comma-separated-list>" [policy flags] --json`.
   Use a single comma-separated `--items` value such as `"978,979"`.
4. When `policyRecommendation.requiresConfirmation` is true in the prelude JSON,
   present policy/checkpoint recommendations and continue only after human
   acceptance, customization, or waiver.
5. Read `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`
   and follow it in `explicit_list` mode with the supplied targets as the hard
   bounded scope.
6. Before dispatching any Backlog item into Writing Spec, run
   `scripts/development-workflow/spec-dispatch-context.sh` for the selected
   item and explicit item list. Pass non-blocking confirmed decisions and
   relationship outcomes to the item/spec handoff; stop on `blocking=true` and
   report the helper's `humanAction`. Shared keywords alone are not dependency
   evidence.
7. Target `develop` directly; `/run-items` does not create or target
   `develop-<slug>` integration branches.
8. Before implementation mutation in `workflow_hub`, state the selected product
   repository, artifact owner, and mutation target for each in-scope item or
   runner. Follow the canonical
   [implementation routing classifier](../../../docs/workflow/development-workflow/repository-modes.md#implementation-routing-classifier)
   contract per item; a batch may contain different product repositories, but
   one item's routing result must not govern another item.
9. For each in-scope item, pass the approved base and artifact-owning repo root
   to branch and PR creation paths and require
   `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh --mode <pre-create|pre-pr> --issue <number> --expected-branch <branch> --approved-base <branch> --repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT"` before mutation. Stop on
   `missing_base`, `blocked_duplicate`, `wrong_base`, or `scan_failed` instead
   of widening scope or inferring a base.
10. Before dispatching an explicit-list batch where any runner may mutate,
   including sequential fallback, build the Protocol 90 isolation manifest and
   require a distinct absolute worktree path plus `isolation: "worktree"` for
   every mutating item. Stop before dispatch on missing isolation assignment or
   duplicate worktree path; non-isolated runners are exempt only when explicitly
   classified `read_only` and they will not edit files, switch branches, commit,
   push, mutate PRs, change labels, or update tracker state.
   Include the incremental commit requirement in every substantial or
   multi-part mutating runner handoff: commit immediately after each completed
   logical sub-part, do not intentionally batch all completed sub-parts into one
   final commit, and never commit incomplete or failing work only to satisfy the
   rule.
   For checkpoint-resume redispatch, pass the complete isolation assignment plus
   checkpoint state to a fresh runner and require `checkpoint-resume-gate.sh`
   before mutation. Do not resume a paused runner while sibling runners remain
   active, and do not treat isolation verification as satisfying or waiving the
   checkpoint.
11. For plan-writing handoffs in the explicit list, pass the exact current-batch
    item list and any known same-surface open PR evidence to Protocol 02's
    `Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check`. Keep returned `Conflict`
    evidence visible until the parent records `Resolved` or stops for
    `unclear_requirements` and request `Human decision required`; do not widen
    the bounded list or replace this with an all-open-PR scan.
12. Before parallel implementation dispatch, run Protocol 90's planless overlap
   gate from the current tracker snapshot and plan-derived file sets. Concrete
   overlap pairs and suspected pairs without a matching current `allow_parallel`
   decision are serialized by default; pass serial groups into
   `workflow-batch-lanes.sh --overlap-input` or apply the identical hold result.
   Keep the pair IDs, typed evidence, evidence hashes, accepted/stale decisions,
   and held-item reasons visible in the confirmation and final summaries.
13. Do not stop after advancing one item if another item in the explicit list still
   has a deterministic next action.
14. Do not stop at transient in-flight CI/watch states. If a local watch exits
   early, duplicate checks are skipped/cancelled, or GitHub still shows pending
   or incomplete check evidence, re-query authoritative PR/check state and keep
   supervising until every in-scope PR is green, blocked, escalated, merged, or
   held by guardrails.
   For sweep, batch, helper-extraction, numeric-target, or pattern-completeness
   items, require residual gate evidence before accepting an item as
   `ready-for-human-review`.
15. For `spec/*` and `implementation-plan/*` PRs, require Protocol 91 Step 8a's
   documentation-stage alignment checker before accepting readiness. A
   mismatch keeps the item under supervision until corrected or escalated.
16. Before accepting any in-scope item as terminal, require the item runner's
   `## Ground-Truth Completion Verification` output from
   `item-completion-self-check.sh` or run the helper directly from current
   artifact state. When Step 7 was configured, pass `--require-review-summary true`
   and `--require-review-threads true` (helper defaults are false). Missing
   self-check evidence, `discrepancy`, or `unavailable_required` keeps the item
   under Protocol 90 Step 5 supervision.
17. After all in-scope PRs reach `ready-for-human-review`, inspect the effective
   guardrails. When the relevant stages allow `may_merge_pr: true`, run
   Guardrails Enforcement Gate 5 for each in-scope PR, including
   `run-epic-risk-classifier.sh` and `run-epic-delegated-gate.sh`; continue only
   when every normally merged in-scope PR returns `merge_allowed`. If any PR returns
   `exceptional_bypass_authorized`, split it out of the normal batch-merge list
   and require the separate named PR/SHA/fingerprint authorization plus
   pre-attempt `reviewer-access-bypass` audit before one exact admin merge
   attempt; delegated/batch approval does not authorize `--admin`. The bounded-prelude
   confirmation (or explicit autonomy flags) recorded for this `/run-items`
   invocation is the required merge gate for normal Protocol 90 `explicit_list`
   batches, but it never waives the separate admin-merge authorization.
   Then route normal candidates into Protocol 94 batch merge using only the
   explicit in-scope PR list:
   run
   `batch-merge.sh discover --prs <comma-separated-in-scope-prs>` and continue
   through merge, cleanup, post-sibling-merge `recheck-remaining` calls, and
   tracker reconciliation. Keep the explicit PR list frozen for every
   `batch-merge.sh recheck-remaining --prs <comma-separated-in-scope-prs> --after-merged-pr <number> --base <target-base> --approved-unready-prs <human-included-unready-prs>`
   invocation; apply Protocol 94 Step 4.2 as the source of truth for
   post-recheck admission semantics. Report refreshed held PRs as
   `merge_blocked` and read-only observations as `out_of_scope`. Delegated
   batch merge authority never authorizes force-pushing a PR branch; if a
   destructive PR branch update would be required, stop before mutation and
   route the exact operation through
   `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-branch-push-guard.sh`. In
   `workflow_hub`, resolve the helper from `WORKFLOW_TOOL_ROOT` and pass the
   pushed checkout as `--repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT"`. Never use
   Protocol 94 auto-discovery from `/run-items`. If any stage does not allow merge, finish at the
   `ready-for-human-review` handoff, report the exact
   `stages.<stage>.may_merge_pr: false` guardrail for each affected PR, and tell
   the human to invoke `$batch-merge` or adjust guardrails to permit delegated
   merging.
   Report terminal outcomes per in-scope PR as `merged`,
   `ready_human_merge`, `merge_blocked`, `policy_inconsistent`, or
   `out_of_scope`. A `merge_granted` PR that stops at readiness without a
   named blocker is `policy_inconsistent`; a `merge_denied` PR stops at
   `ready_human_merge`.
18. For single-item advancement use `$run-item`; for epic-scoped runs use `$run-epic`;
   for read-only portfolio scan and proposal use `$run-work`.

> **Deprecation notice**: `/run-epic --items` is deprecated. Use `/run-items` for
