# Run Work

This is the Codex command-style alias for Claude Code `/run-work`.

`/run-work` is **portfolio scan and batch proposal only** — a fully read-only
command. It performs no mutation in any routing mode.

| Routing mode | Action |
| ------------ | ------ |
| `no_target_scan` | Protocol 90 scan + propose (no dispatch); operator uses `$run-items` to execute |
| `redirect_items` | Stop; tell the user to run `$run-items` with the resolved targets |
| `redirect_item` | Stop; tell the user to run `$run-item` with the resolved target |
| `redirect_epic` | Stop; tell the user to run `$run-epic --epic <n>` |
| `ambiguous` | Stop; report `stopReason` |

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide rules.
2. Run `./scripts/development-workflow/run-work-router.sh [<target>...] [--json]`.
3. Stop with **no mutation** when any routing mode other than `no_target_scan` is
   returned, or when stdout includes `REDIRECT_COMMAND=` (key=value output).
   With `--json`, also check `redirectCommand` in the routing record.
4. For `no_target_scan`, follow Protocol 90 Steps 1–3 (scan + propose) only.
   Do **not** dispatch items — present the proposal and emit the recommended
   `/run-items` command for the operator to execute.
   When proposing multiple implementation items, include Protocol 90's
   planless overlap disposition from `workflow-batch-overlap.sh`: concrete
   pairs and unconfirmed suspected pairs are serialized by default, and the
   proposal shows pair IDs, typed evidence, evidence hashes, and held-item
   reasons.
5. In `no_target_scan` output, keep Protocol 90 report categories distinct:
   `INFORMATIONAL - not actionable in this proposal`,
   `ACTIONABLE RESUME - can advance now`,
   `PROPOSED BATCH - your decision`, and
   `HELD - not included in proposed batch`. Approval applies only to
   `PROPOSED BATCH - your decision` items; informational records are excluded
   unless the operator explicitly names them in a separate bounded command.
6. In `workflow_hub`, preserve selected product repository context in
   implementation handoffs so later mutation-oriented commands can route the
   artifact owner, local path or remote identity, and PR/reviewer/cleanup work
   without re-resolving or guessing.
7. For single-item advancement use `$run-item`; for epic bounded runs use `$run-epic`;
   for multi-item execution use `$run-items`.
8. When presenting executable follow-ups, include the resolved base branch when
   known so later mutation-oriented commands can pass it to
   `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh --approved-base`. Do not infer a base during
   the read-only scan.
