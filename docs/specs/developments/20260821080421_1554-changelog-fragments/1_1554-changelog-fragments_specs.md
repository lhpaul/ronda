# Changelog Fragments — Spec

---

## Overview

Today every work item records its release note in one shared block at the top of the changelog. When several items are worked in parallel, they all edit the same few lines, so each one collides with the ones merged before it. Resolving a collision is quick; what follows is not — the resolution changes the branch, and every approval that was granted against the previous version of that branch is discarded and has to be earned again.

This feature gives each work item its own changelog file. Two items worked at the same time no longer touch the same place, so the collisions stop happening rather than being resolved more cleverly. At release time the individual files are gathered into the changelog as a draft section, which the person cutting the release edits before publishing, exactly as they do today.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Recording a release note while working an item

**Actor**: Anyone completing a work item — a person or an AI agent
**Preconditions**: The item has changes worth telling users about, and a work branch exists.

**Steps**:

1. The author writes their release note in a new file that belongs to their item alone.
2. The author states which kind of change it is, using the same kinds the changelog already uses (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security).
3. The author opens the pull request as usual.

**Postconditions**: The item carries its own release note. No other in-flight item is affected by it.

**Information shown**:

- Readiness checks confirm the item carries a release note, without requiring the shared changelog to have been edited.

**Actions available**:

- Edit the note at any time before release, without affecting other items.
- Omit the note deliberately for changes that need no release note, as is permitted today.

**Considerations**:

- Two items completed on the same day must never be able to claim the same file.
- An author must not have to know what any other in-flight item is doing.

### Use Case 2: Cutting a release

**Actor**: The person preparing a release
**Preconditions**: One or more merged items carry release notes that have not yet been released.

**Steps**:

1. The releaser starts release preparation as they do today.
2. Every unreleased note is gathered into a single draft section for the new version, grouped by kind of change.
3. The releaser reads the draft as a whole and edits it — tightening wording, merging duplicates, cutting implementation detail — which is the same editorial pass performed today.
4. The releaser publishes the release.

**Postconditions**: The changelog contains a finished section for the new version. The notes that fed it are consumed, so nothing can be released twice. The changelog is left ready to accumulate the next release's notes, and its version links continue to work.

**Information shown**:

- The assembled draft, grouped by kind of change, with every unreleased note present.

**Actions available**:

- Edit any part of the draft before publishing.
- Resume an interrupted release preparation without losing notes or prior edits.

**Considerations**:

- The releaser sees the whole release at once. This is the point of the step, and it is why gathering produces a draft rather than a finished section.
- Notes are consumed when the release is **published**, not when the draft is assembled. Until publication succeeds, every note still exists — so an interrupted preparation loses nothing.
- A note recorded after the draft was assembled belongs to the **next** release, not the one being prepared. Otherwise a note could be silently swept into a release nobody reviewed it for.
- For one release only, notes may exist in both the old shared block and the new per-item files. Both must appear in the draft.

### Use Case 3: Shipping an urgent fix to production

**Actor**: Anyone completing an urgent production fix
**Preconditions**: A defect in released software needs to ship immediately, outside the normal release cycle.

**Steps**:

1. The author writes the release note directly into the changelog as a finished, versioned section, as they do today.

**Postconditions**: The changelog carries the new version. Nothing about the urgent path changes.

**Considerations**:

- Urgent fixes release on merge, so there is no later gathering step for them to feed. Routing them through per-item files would add a step that never pays off.

## Business Rules

- A work item's release note belongs to that item alone. No two in-flight items may need to edit the same content to record their notes.
- Every release note carries one kind of change, drawn from the set the changelog already uses.
- A release note is written once and survives unchanged until a release consumes it, unless its author edits it.
- A note is consumed only when the release that contains it is published. Assembling a draft never destroys anything, so an interrupted release preparation loses neither notes nor the releaser's edits.
- Once a note has been released it cannot be gathered again, and no unreleased note may be silently left behind.
- The set of notes in a release is fixed when its draft is assembled. A note recorded afterward belongs to the next release, never retroactively to the one being prepared.
- Gathering is repeatable. Running it twice in a row must leave the same result as running it once.
- Publishing a release leaves the changelog ready to accumulate the next release's notes, and every version link in it continues to resolve.
- The changelog remains the permanent record of everything released. This feature changes only how notes accumulate before a release, never the released history.
- Readiness checks that today confirm an item recorded a release note must accept a per-item note as satisfying that requirement.
- Urgent production fixes keep writing finished versioned sections directly, and are never gathered.
- For the single release that spans the transition, notes already recorded in the shared block are released alongside per-item notes, with nothing lost or duplicated.

---

## Operational Visibility

- **Logs**: The gathering step reports how many notes it gathered and which items they came from, so a releaser can confirm nothing was missed. Notes carried over from the old shared block have no owning item, and are reported as a single group rather than attributed individually.
- **Audit trail**: Consumed notes are removed as part of the release, making "released" and "not yet released" visible from the repository state rather than inferred.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Two work items completed at the same time, both recording release notes, merge one after the other without either needing a conflict resolved, and both notes are present afterward.
- [ ] A pull request that records a release note the new way passes the readiness check that confirms a release note exists, without editing the shared changelog.
- [ ] Preparing a release gathers every unreleased note into a draft section for the new version, grouped by kind of change, with no note missing.
- [ ] The releaser can edit the assembled draft before publishing, and the published section reflects their edits.
- [ ] A release preparation interrupted after the draft is assembled can be resumed with no note lost and the releaser's edits intact.
- [ ] A note recorded after a draft is assembled does not appear in that release, and is still available for the next one.
- [ ] After a release, no consumed note remains, and running the gathering step again produces no duplicate entries.
- [ ] After publishing, the changelog is ready to accumulate the next release's notes, and every version link in it resolves to the right comparison.
- [ ] The published version section is well-formed changelog content that passes the repository's existing document checks.
- [ ] A release cut during the transition includes both the notes already in the shared block and the per-item notes, each appearing exactly once.
- [ ] An urgent production fix still writes its own finished versioned section and is unaffected by gathering.
- [ ] A project created from this template records release notes the new way without additional setup.
- [ ] The changelog's existing published history is unchanged by adopting this feature.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Converting the release notes already sitting in the shared block into per-item files. They stay where they are and are released from there once.
- Any change to how urgent production fixes are recorded.
- Automatic generation of release notes from commits, pull request titles, or issue text. Notes stay author-written.
- Changing which kinds of change the changelog recognises, or the format of published version sections.
- A migration tool for projects already created from this template that want to convert existing shared-block entries.
- Enforcing a quality bar on individual notes at the time they are written. The release editorial pass remains where quality is set.
