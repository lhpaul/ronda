## Summary

**Approach**: `REVIEW.md` already carries three stage checklists — Spec, Plan
and Code — under a shared Core Rules section. The local reviewer does not use
that structure. The bundled preset's prompt says only *"Review this PR change
using REVIEW.md"*, so on every PR the reviewer receives a 414-line contract
containing three checklists and has to infer, unaided, which one governs. There
is no fourth checklist for changes to the workflow's own policy surface —
`REVIEW.md`, the protocols, the best-practices set, `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`,
`scripts/development-workflow/**` — which is what most of this epic's own pull
requests change.

This plan resolves a **review stage** from the head branch, derives an
**additional checklist** from the changed files, names the selected sections in
the prompt, and emits the selection as evidence. It adds the missing Workflow
Policy checklist to `REVIEW.md`.

The whole design rests on one property, and every other decision follows from
it: **checklist selection is additive and monotone**. `REVIEW.md` as a whole and
its Core Rules always apply; naming a stage section directs attention to it and
removes nothing. The file-derived class can only *add* a checklist to the one
the branch implied, never replace or drop it. An unrecognised branch selects
nothing and produces today's prompt byte-for-byte. Every degradation path —
unknown branch, unreadable diff, empty changed-file list — therefore lands on
behavior that is at worst identical to today's and never narrower.

**Estimated complexity**: M

**Rationale**: The code is small — one resolver, three new bundle fields,
three new evidence keys, one prompt sentence — and concentrated in two scripts that
this epic already touches. What makes it more than small is that it changes what
a reviewer is *told to look for*, and the failure mode is silent: a stage
selection that narrows attention produces a confident `clean` on a PR whose
defect lives in a section the prompt did not name. That failure leaves no trace
in any log, so the monotonicity property has to be enforced by construction and
demonstrated by planted proof rather than asserted.

**Dependencies**: None. This item touches `local-ai-reviewer.sh` and
`local-codex-review-command.sh`; #1648, #1649, #1651 and #1652 all touch
`pr-review-loop.sh`. The only shared file is `REVIEW.md`, and this item appends
a section rather than editing existing ones. See **Risks** for the deliberate
near-duplication with #1652's normative-path list.

## Verification Log

| Check | Command / query | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo revision | `git rev-parse --short origin/develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` | `3901d6e1` — after #1660, #1661, #1662 and #1663 merged. Every line-number reference below was re-read at this revision |
| `REVIEW.md` already has stage checklists | `awk '/^## /{print NR": "$0}' REVIEW.md` | Five level-2 sections: `Core Rules` (14), `Spec Review Checklist` (64), `Plan Review Checklist` (113), `Code Review Checklist` (198), `Tool Guidance` (379). **Three** stage checklists exist; there is no workflow-policy checklist |
| The prompt is stage-agnostic today | `sed -n '15p' scripts/development-workflow/local-codex-review-command.sh` | The default prompt names `REVIEW.md` once, as a whole, with no section reference. It is the only prompt the bundled preset builds |
| The context bundle carries no stage | `sed -n '339,366p' scripts/development-workflow/local-ai-reviewer.sh` | `local_ai_reviewer_context.v1` has thirteen fields; none describes the branch type or the kind of change. `head_branch` is present, so the raw input for a resolver already reaches the command — nothing derived from it does |
| The loop forwards unknown keys unchanged | `sed -n '754,772p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `emit_prefixed_platform_output` re-emits **every** key it reads as `PLATFORM_<n>_<KEY>`, skipping only `RESULT`, `PR_NUMBER`, `BRANCH`, `FIX_AGENT` and `PLATFORM`. New evidence keys surface in the loop summary with no change to `pr-review-loop.sh` |
| A branch→stage map already exists, and is narrower | `sed -n '114,120p' scripts/development-workflow/check-documentation-stage-alignment.sh` | `stage_for_head` maps `spec/*`→`spec`, `implementation-plan/*`→`plan`, everything else→`not_applicable`. It covers two of the four stages this item needs and is used for a different question — whether the *changed files* match the stage — so it is a naming precedent, not reusable logic |
| The authoritative branch table | `sed -n '10,16p' docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md` | Four implementation paths: `feature/`, `refactor/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`. With `spec/` and `implementation-plan/` from protocols 01 and 02, the workflow defines **six** branch prefixes |
| Those prefixes are the ones actually used | `grep -rhoE '\b(spec\|implementation-plan\|feature\|fix\|refactor\|hotfix)/(\[[a-z_]+\]\|[a-z0-9<{-]+)' docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/*.md \| sed -E 's#/.*#/#' \| sort \| uniq -c` | `feature/` 34, `spec/` 18, `fix/` 9, `hotfix/` 8, `refactor/` 7, `implementation-plan/` 3. All **six** prefixes appear; no seventh does. An earlier revision of this row ran a narrower pattern that missed the `hotfix/[slug]` bracket form entirely and reported five counts under a six-prefix conclusion |
| The preset prompt is overridable | `sed -n '13,18p' scripts/development-workflow/local-codex-review-command.sh` | `LOCAL_CODEX_REVIEWER_PROMPT` short-circuits the built prompt entirely. A caller that sets it receives the stage in the environment and the bundle but not in the prompt text — see **Risks** |

**What this log does not establish.** It does not show that a stage-specific
prompt finds more defects than a generic one; no such measurement exists in this
repository yet, and producing it is #1651's and #1657's work, not this item's.
What it establishes is narrower and sufficient: the structure this item selects
from already exists, the reviewer is currently given no way to use it, and the
plumbing to carry and report a selection is already in place.

## Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check

### Applicable

| Assumption surface | Recorded value | Authoritative source | Verified at | Bounded cross-check scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approved base branch for this item | `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` | `integration-branch:internal-reviewer-effectiveness` label on #1653; Protocol 91 § Integration-branch base override | 2026-08-28, repo SHA `3901d6e1` | Epic #1647 items; #1660, #1661, #1662 and #1663 are merged into this base, and no epic PR is open against it | `Verified` |
| The set of branch prefixes the workflow defines | Six: `spec/`, `implementation-plan/`, `feature/`, `refactor/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/` | Protocol 03 § branch table; protocols 01 and 02 | 2026-08-28, repo SHA `3901d6e1` | `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/*.md` | `Verified` |
| Ownership of `REVIEW.md` | Repository-owned, not template-owned | No `TEMPLATE-OWNED` marker in `REVIEW.md` | 2026-08-28, repo SHA `3901d6e1` | `REVIEW.md` | `Verified` — the new section can be added directly |

### Not applicable

**Overall result for this check**: `Applicable` — the three rows above are the
assumption surfaces, all `Verified`, and the implementer must re-verify each at
implementation start. This subsection scopes only the surfaces that carry **no**
assumption for this plan; it does not soften the result above.

**Surfaces with no assumption**: no database, no runtime service, no
user-facing surface, no scheduled job, no external API and no deployment
target. The change is confined to two review scripts, one contract document,
three agent instruction files, two workflow documents and three test suites.

## Layer-by-Layer Changes

### Database / Data Layer

Not applicable.

### Backend / API

Not applicable — this repository ships workflow tooling, not a service.

### Shared Packages / Libraries

- [ ] **Add the missing fourth checklist to `REVIEW.md`.** A new level-2
      section, `## Workflow Policy Review Checklist`, placed after
      `## Code Review Checklist` and before `## Tool Guidance`. It governs
      changes to the documents and scripts that define how the workflow itself
      behaves, and it asks the questions the Code checklist does not:

      1. Does every stated count match what the document actually contains, by
         extraction rather than by reading?
      2. Does every gate name its inputs, its decision for each combination of
         them, and its behavior when an input is missing or malformed?
      3. Does a rule asserted as fail-closed have a path that reaches the
         permissive branch — an allow-list stated as a deny-list, an empty set
         treated as satisfied, an absent value treated as a match?
      4. Does every new or modified check carry a planted-violation proof at a
         concrete file and line, and can the plant actually change the check's
         answer? A proof whose plant is masked by an earlier rule is not a
         proof.
      5. Does the change alter a `key=value` contract, a JSON schema version, or
         a stdout surface another script parses, and if so is every consumer
         named?
      6. Do the protocol document, the integration document and the `--help`
         output describe the same behavior as the code?

      Each item is phrased as a question with a verifiable answer, matching the
      existing checklists' style. The section is **additive**: Core Rules,
      including the Verification Discipline and Severity rules, continue to
      apply to workflow-policy changes exactly as they do to code.

- [ ] **Add a source-only harness guard to `local-ai-reviewer.sh`.** The script
      has none today: line 145 is `if [ "$#" -lt 3 ]; then usage; exit 2; fi`,
      so sourcing it exits before any function is callable, and the resolvers
      below cannot be unit-tested at all. `pr-review-loop.sh` already solved
      this at its lines 12-19, and the same guard is copied verbatim rather
      than invented:

      ```bash
      _HARNESS_MODE_EFFECTIVE=0
      if [ "${HARNESS_MODE:-0}" -eq 1 ] && [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != "$0" ]; then
        _HARNESS_MODE_EFFECTIVE=1
      fi
      ```

      Both conditions are required, and the second is the safety one:
      `HARNESS_MODE=1` in the environment of a **direct** run must not skip
      argument validation, or an exported variable in someone's shell would
      turn a real review into a no-op. The guard wraps the argument block and
      everything after it; the three resolver functions are defined **above**
      it, beside the existing helpers, so a sourced script defines them and
      stops.

      This is a structural change to a script this item otherwise only adds to,
      and it is the one part of the plan not implied by the brief. It is here
      because the alternative — testing eleven branch inputs by running the
      whole reviewer eleven times through its mock harness — buys nothing and
      costs a slow suite. Scenario 0 tests the guard itself in both directions.

- [ ] **Resolve the review stage in `local-ai-reviewer.sh`.** Three functions
      and one merge step, placed with the other pre-invocation helpers, above
      the harness guard.

      1. `reviewer_stage_for_branch <head_branch>` — the branch tier. Six
         recognised prefixes mapping to three stages, and `default` for
         everything else:

         | Head branch | Stage | Checklist named |
         | --- | --- | --- |
         | `spec/*` | `spec` | Spec Review Checklist |
         | `implementation-plan/*` | `plan` | Plan Review Checklist |
         | `feature/*`, `refactor/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*` | `implementation` | Code Review Checklist |
         | anything else, or an empty branch name | `default` | none |

         The mapping is a `case` over the literal prefixes, not a regular
         expression, so a branch named `specification/foo` does not match
         `spec/*` by accident.

      2. `reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy` — the file tier. It
         reads **newline-delimited paths on stdin**, one per line, and returns
         success when **any** of them matches the workflow-policy set.

         **The input is not the JSON array.** `changed_files_json` is a compact
         JSON array — the value `jq -R -s -c` produces and the bundle embeds —
         so a path never appears as a bare string in it. The caller decodes it
         with `jq -r '.[]?'` **into a variable**, then feeds the predicate from
         a here-string; the predicate itself never parses JSON.

         **The decode must not be a pipeline into the predicate.**
         `local-ai-reviewer.sh` runs under `set -euo pipefail` (line 7). The
         predicate returns as soon as it sees a match, so on a changed-file
         list long enough to exceed the pipe buffer `jq` is still writing when
         the reader goes away, takes `SIGPIPE`, and exits 141. `pipefail` then
         makes the whole pipeline non-zero, the `elif` is not taken, and the
         Workflow Policy checklist is silently omitted — on exactly the large,
         mixed pull requests where it matters most, and never on the small ones
         a test would use by default. Buffering the decode removes the failure
         rather than tolerating it: with a here-string no pipeline status
         exists for `pipefail` to act on.

         A failed decode — malformed JSON — is **not** silently swallowed into
         the empty case by `|| true`. It sets the decoded list to empty, which
         means the branch-implied checklist and nothing added. That is the safe
         direction, because the file tier only ever adds, and it is recorded
         rather than masked: the caller warns on stderr. Two reasons for the split: the predicate stays testable from a
         heredoc without `jq`, and the decode happens exactly once, at the one
         call site, rather than being re-derived by every future caller.
         Scenario 5a exercises the decode through the caller with a real
         `changed_files_json` value, because a predicate that is correct on
         newlines and a caller that feeds it JSON is a defect no test of either
         one alone can see. The matched set:

         | Pattern | Why it is workflow policy |
         | --- | --- |
         | `REVIEW.md` | the review contract itself |
         | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `LLM_RULES.md` | the agent instruction surfaces |
         | `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` | the workflow's configuration contract |
         | `docs/workflow/*` | the protocols |
         | `docs/best-practices/*` | the implementer-facing rules the protocols cite |
         | `scripts/development-workflow/*` | the scripts that enforce all of the above |
         | `.claude/*`, `.cursor/*`, `.codex/*`, `.agents/*` | the per-tool agent, command, skill and rule files — the same instructions as the root agent surfaces, mirrored per tool |

         Seven rows, written as **thirteen `case` entries** — six literal
         filenames and seven directory prefixes.

         The four per-tool trees were missing from an earlier revision, and
         **this plan is the proof they belong**: it edits
         `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`, `.cursor/agents/code-reviewer.md`
         and `.codex/skills/workflow-code-reviewer/SKILL.md`, and a pull request
         changing only those three would not have selected the Workflow Policy
         checklist. An instruction file that tells a reviewer what to check is
         workflow policy whether it sits at the repository root or under a
         tool's directory. `.github/workflows/*` is deliberately **excluded**: CI
         configuration is ordinary code, reviewed by the Code checklist, and
         including it would pull every dependency bump into the policy stage.

      3. The merge, which is where the monotonicity property lives. The
         checklist set is the branch-implied checklist **union** the
         file-derived one:

         | Branch stage | Any policy file changed? | Stage reported | Checklists named |
         | --- | --- | --- | --- |
         | `spec` | no | `spec` | Spec |
         | `spec` | yes | `spec` | Spec, Workflow Policy |
         | `plan` | no | `plan` | Plan |
         | `plan` | yes | `plan` | Plan, Workflow Policy |
         | `implementation` | no | `implementation` | Code |
         | `implementation` | yes | `implementation` | Code, Workflow Policy |
         | `default` | no | `default` | none |
         | `default` | yes | `default` | none |

         Eight rows, every combination of the two inputs, no row omitted. Two
         of them carry the load and both are counter-intuitive enough to state
         outright:

         - **`default` + policy files → still nothing.** The brief's third
           scope bullet requires unknown branch types to keep their current
           behavior, and the current behavior is a prompt that names no
           section. Adding a checklist there would change it. `default` is the
           one stage whose prompt must stay byte-identical to today's, so the
           file tier is not consulted for it. This is the only asymmetry in the
           table and it is required by the brief.
         - **The file tier never subtracts.** An `implementation` branch whose
           changed files are *entirely* workflow policy still gets the Code
           checklist, plus Workflow Policy. The alternative — letting the files
           override the branch — was rejected: it makes the two tiers
           disagreeable, forces a precedence rule, and its only benefit is a
           shorter prompt. Union has no precedence question to get wrong.

      4. `review_stage_source` records which tiers contributed: `branch` when
         only the branch matched, `branch+files` when the file tier added the
         policy checklist, and `none` for `default`. Three values, one per
         reachable state of the table above.

- [ ] **Carry the selection in the context bundle.** Three fields added to the
      `jq -n` object, and the schema version left at
      `local_ai_reviewer_context.v1`:

      ```text
      review_stage:            "spec" | "plan" | "implementation" | "default"
      review_stage_source:     "branch" | "branch+files" | "none"
      review_checklists:       ["Spec Review Checklist", ...]   # ordered, may be empty
      ```

      `review_checklists` holds the **exact level-2 heading text** from
      `REVIEW.md`, not a line number and not a slug. Headings are stable and
      greppable; line numbers move whenever the contract is edited, which this
      very item does.

      **Why the version stays at `.v1`.** Bumping it would be the more
      conventional choice, and it is wrong here. The only two references to
      `local_ai_reviewer_context.v1` in the repository are the producer at
      `local-ai-reviewer.sh:352` and a prose description in the integration
      document; nothing validates it, and a custom `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWER_COMMAND`
      that *does* check it would break on a bump while working fine with three
      added fields it ignores. The change is purely additive: every v1 field
      keeps its name, type and meaning. Scenario 12 asserts exactly that, field
      by field, so the claim is tested rather than promised.

- [ ] **Emit the selection as evidence.** Three `print_kv` calls beside the
      existing `BASE_BRANCH` / `REVIEWED_HEAD` / `GRAPH_CONTEXT` block:
      `REVIEW_STAGE`, `REVIEW_STAGE_SOURCE` and `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` — the last
      as a comma-separated list of the same heading strings on **one line**.

      The contract has exactly one hard requirement, and it is worth separating
      from the taste question: the value must contain **no newline**.
      `emit_prefixed_platform_output` reads its input line by line, so a
      multi-line value's second line is re-emitted as a key of its own —
      `PLATFORM_1_Workflow Policy Review Checklist=` — fabricating a key and
      truncating the real value to its first entry. Proof P7 plants that, and
      scenario 13 observes the fabricated key rather than asserting a preferred
      format.

      Comma versus JSON is **not** a correctness question: a compact JSON array
      contains no newline either, and the loop forwards the value opaquely
      without parsing it. Comma is chosen for readability in a summary a human
      reads, and this plan says so rather than dressing a style choice as a
      safety one.

      No change is needed in `pr-review-loop.sh`: `emit_prefixed_platform_output`
      forwards any key it does not explicitly skip, so these arrive in the loop
      summary as `PLATFORM_<n>_REVIEW_STAGE` and siblings. Scenario 13 asserts
      that, because "no change needed elsewhere" is exactly the kind of claim
      that is true until it is not.

      The same three values are added to the evidence JSON written by
      `write_evidence_file`, under a `review_stage` object, so an evidence file
      answers *which checklist produced this verdict* without re-deriving it
      from the branch name.

- [ ] **Name the checklists in the bundled preset's prompt.** In
      `local-codex-review-command.sh`, one sentence inserted into the default
      prompt when `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` is non-empty:

      > This change is at the `<stage>` stage. Apply `REVIEW.md` in full,
      > including its Core Rules, and give particular weight to its
      > `<checklist>` section(s).

      **"In full, including its Core Rules" is load-bearing, not padding.** It
      is what makes the selection additive rather than substitutive, and it is
      the single sentence proof P4 removes. When `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` is empty —
      stage `default` — no sentence is inserted and the prompt is the current
      string, unchanged character for character.

      `local-ai-reviewer.sh` exports **all three** — `REVIEW_STAGE`,
      `REVIEW_STAGE_SOURCE` and `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` — alongside the existing
      `CONTEXT_BUNDLE_PATH` / `PR_NUMBER` / `OWNER` / `REPO` / `BASE_BRANCH` /
      `HEAD_BRANCH` / `REVIEWED_HEAD` set. The bundled preset reads two of them;
      it has no use for the source. The third is exported anyway so that the
      three surfaces a command can read from — environment, bundle and
      evidence — carry the same three values, and a custom
      `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWER_COMMAND` that wants to distinguish a branch-only
      selection from a file-augmented one does not have to re-derive it.
      Scenario 15a asserts all three are present in the command's environment.

### Frontend / UI

Not applicable.

### Infrastructure / Configuration

- [ ] Document `REVIEW_STAGE`, `REVIEW_STAGE_SOURCE` and `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` in
      the `local-ai-reviewer.sh` `--help` usage block, in the same environment
      table that already documents `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWER_*`.

---

## Testing Strategy

**Test types**: Unit (shell harness), plus the smoke test runbook.

**Key scenarios to test**:

0. The harness guard, in both directions. Sourcing the script with
   `HARNESS_MODE=1` defines `reviewer_stage_for_branch`,
   `reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy` and
   `reviewer_resolve_review_stage`, and exits nothing. Executing it **directly**
   with `HARNESS_MODE=1` in the environment and no arguments still prints usage
   and exits 2. The second half is the safety property: a guard that keyed on
   the variable alone would let a stray export disable argument validation on a
   real run.
1. `reviewer_stage_for_branch` returns the mapped stage for each of the six
   recognised prefixes, one case per prefix.
2. It returns `default` for five controls: an empty branch name, `main`,
   `develop`, `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness`, and
   `specification/foo` — the last because a prefix `case` must not match a
   longer word that merely starts with it.
3. `reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy` returns success for one path
   per `case` entry — **thirteen** cases, six literal filenames and seven
   directory prefixes, including `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` and
   `.agents/skills/x/SKILL.md` — and failure for four controls:
   `docs/specs/developments/x/1_x_specs.md`, `docs/project/1-business-domain.md`,
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `src/app/main.ts`.
4. It returns success when **one** path of many matches, and failure when none
   does. The predicate is `any`, not `all`.
5. It returns failure for an **empty** changed-file list, so an unreadable or
   empty diff degrades to the branch-implied checklist rather than adding one.
5b. An **early match followed by a long tail**: a changed-file list whose first
    entry is `REVIEW.md`, followed by enough further paths that the decoded
    output exceeds **twice the host's maximum pipe capacity**. The Workflow
    Policy checklist is still added.

    The bound is **derived at test time, not fixed**. A pipe holds 64 KiB by
    default on Linux and macOS; macOS caps there, but on Linux the ceiling is
    `fs.pipe-max-size`, writable by root and larger on some hosts. A fixed
    fixture — 2 MiB included — is therefore not deterministic: on a host with a
    4 MiB ceiling and a pipe sized to it the whole list fits, `jq` never
    blocks, never takes SIGPIPE, and the planted pipeline passes. A proof that
    can fail to fail is not a proof.

    The test reads `/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size` when present, doubles it, floors
    the result at 2 MiB for hosts without `/proc`, and grows the fixture in a
    loop until `wc -c` measures past the target. It asserts **bytes**, never
    path count: 40,000 paths of the runbook's shape measure 2,428,900 bytes and
    20,000 measure 1,208,900, so path length is the variable that silently
    shrinks the fixture when someone shortens the generated names.
5a. The **decode** is exercised through `reviewer_resolve_review_stage` with a
    real `changed_files_json` value — the compact JSON array `jq -R -s -c`
    produces, such as `["REVIEW.md","src/app/main.ts"]` — and with the two
    degenerate values `[]` and `""`. The first must add the Workflow Policy
    checklist; the other two must not. A predicate that is correct on
    newline-delimited input and a caller that hands it the raw array is a
    defect neither a predicate test nor a merge test can see on its own, and
    the raw array matches no `case` arm, so the checklist would simply never be
    added.
6. The merge produces each of the eight rows of the decision table, one case
   per row, asserting stage, source and checklist list together — not stage
   alone, because the stage is the value least able to reveal a wrong merge.
7. The `default` rows produce an **empty** checklist list under both file
   conditions. This is the asymmetry the brief requires and the one a later
   editor is most likely to "fix".
8. `implementation` with policy files names **both** Code and Workflow Policy,
   in that order — branch-implied first. Order is asserted because the prompt
   renders the list in order and a reader weights the first named section most.
8a. The three Pass-restricted surfaces each carry the workflow-policy sentence,
    and the three copies are **identical** — compared to each other, not merely
    present. Mirrored guidance that drifts is the failure this repository's
    Haystack rule already tracks, and three hand-edited copies are exactly where
    it starts.
9. Every checklist name the resolver can emit exists in `REVIEW.md` as a
   level-2 heading, tested by grepping the contract for the exact string. This
   is the scenario that fails if someone renames a section without touching the
   resolver, which is the most likely way this feature silently degrades.
10. The prompt built by the preset contains the words "in full" and "Core Rules"
    whenever it names any checklist. The monotonicity property, asserted at the
    only place it is expressible.
11. With stage `default`, the preset's prompt is **byte-identical** to the
    current default prompt string, compared against a fixture copy of it rather
    than against a regenerated one.
12. The context bundle retains all thirteen `local_ai_reviewer_context.v1`
    fields with unchanged names and types, and adds exactly three. Asserted
    field by field against an enumerated list, not by a count.
13. `emit_prefixed_platform_output` forwards `REVIEW_STAGE`,
    `REVIEW_STAGE_SOURCE` and `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` as `PLATFORM_1_*` keys,
    exercised through the real function rather than assumed from its source.
14. The evidence JSON contains the `review_stage` object with all three values,
    and remains valid `local_ai_reviewer_evidence.v1`.
15a. The command's environment carries all three values, asserted with a stub
    `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWER_COMMAND` that dumps its own environment. Exporting two of
    three would leave the environment disagreeing with the bundle and the
    evidence file, which both carry all three.
15. A `LOCAL_CODEX_REVIEWER_PROMPT` override still wins: the stage sentence is
    not appended to it. The override contract is unchanged, and a caller who set
    it before this item gets exactly what they got before.

**Files**:

- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-local-ai-reviewer.sh` — scenarios 0
  through 9, including 5a and 5b, and 12 and 14, as new cases in the existing
  harness.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-local-codex-review-command.sh` —
  scenarios 10, 11, 15 and 15a, the prompt-construction and command-handoff
  cases. This suite already
  exists and already declares
  `# covers: scripts/development-workflow/local-codex-review-command.sh`, so
  the preset's new behavior belongs here rather than in the reviewer suite.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` — scenario 13
  only, which needs the loop's own harness to call
  `emit_prefixed_platform_output` for real.

  All three suites already declare `# covers:` headers, so no
  `select-test-suites.sh` change is needed: the naming-convention fallback is
  already disabled for each of them and each already declares the file this
  item edits.

**Smoke test runbook**:
`docs/testing/workflow/1653-split-reviewer-prompts-by-stage.smoke-test.md`

**Regression suite**: the repository's regression surface for workflow scripts
is the shell harnesses named above; all **three** are extended in this item —
`test-local-ai-reviewer.sh`, `test-local-codex-review-command.sh` and
`test-pr-review-loop.sh`.

| Fixture | Contents | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Branch fixture | The six recognised prefixes of scenario 1 and the five controls of scenario 2 | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-local-ai-reviewer.sh` |
| Changed-file fixture | One path per `case` entry — thirteen — the four non-matching controls of scenario 3, a mixed list for scenario 4, the empty list of scenario 5, and scenario 5b's list beginning with `REVIEW.md`, grown in a loop until `wc -c` measures past twice the host's `fs.pipe-max-size` (floor 2 MiB where `/proc` is absent) | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-local-ai-reviewer.sh` |

## Cross-Cutting Checklist Classification

**Classification**: `Cross-cutting checklist` — **applicable**. Protocol 02's
first signal is *"adding or renaming a checklist category in `REVIEW.md`"*, and
this plan adds `## Workflow Policy Review Checklist`. The other two signals do
not apply: no acceptance criterion is imposed on every plan, and no conditional
guidance block is added to a planning or implementation protocol.

**Live search**, run at `3901d6e1` rather than reasoned about:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

```bash
grep -rl "REVIEW\.md" .claude .cursor .codex .agents
grep -rl "Code Review Checklist\|Spec Review Checklist\|Plan Review Checklist" \
  .claude .cursor .codex
```

The first returns fifteen files; the second returns **none**. That second result
is the finding that shapes this section: no agent or skill file enumerates the
*set* of `REVIEW.md` checklists, so adding a fourth section does not invalidate
any of them. They reference the contract as a whole, or a `Pass` sub-checklist
inside the Code checklist, which this item does not touch.

### Files to modify

| File | Change | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REVIEW.md` | **Edit** | the new `## Workflow Policy Review Checklist` section |
| `scripts/development-workflow/local-ai-reviewer.sh` | **Edit** | harness guard, three resolvers, bundle fields, evidence keys, `--help` |
| `scripts/development-workflow/local-codex-review-command.sh` | **Edit** | the stage sentence |
| `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/local-ai-reviewer.md` | **Edit** | bundle fields, evidence keys, the decision table, the custom-command caveat |
| `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md` | **Edit** | the new `PLATFORM_<n>_REVIEW_*` keys in loop summaries |
| `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`, `.cursor/agents/code-reviewer.md`, `.codex/skills/workflow-code-reviewer/SKILL.md` | **Edit** | one identical sentence each, so the new checklist is reachable from the native review paths |
| The three test suites in **Testing Strategy** | **Edit** | new scenarios |

### Enumerated not-applicable surfaces

Every target Protocol 02 names at minimum, with a reason rather than a silent
omission:

| File | Result | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` | `Not applicable` | the plan-writing procedure is unchanged; nothing is required of future plans |
| `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md` | `Not applicable` | the implementation procedure is unchanged; the new checklist is applied *by a reviewer*, not followed by an implementer |
| `.claude/agents/developer.md`, `.cursor/agents/developer.md` | `Not applicable` | both reference `REVIEW.md` as a whole and neither enumerates its sections |
| `.claude/agents/tech-lead.md`, `.cursor/agents/tech-lead.md` | `Not applicable` | planning behavior is unchanged; their `REVIEW.md` reference is to the cross-cutting rule itself, which this plan follows rather than modifies |
| `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`, `.cursor/agents/code-reviewer.md` | **Edit** — see below | *"evaluate **only** the `### Pass 1` sub-checklist… Do not evaluate code quality items"*. The restriction is exclusive, so a sibling level-2 section is structurally unreachable from these paths |
| `.codex/skills/workflow-code-reviewer/SKILL.md` | **Edit** — see below | same restriction, stated as *"restrict evaluation to the corresponding `REVIEW.md` sub-checklist"* |
| `.codex/skills/workflow-plan-writer/SKILL.md` | `Not applicable` | mirrors the tech-lead cross-cutting rule; unchanged |
| `.cursor/commands/review-code.md`, `review-spec.md`, `review-implementation-plan.md` | `Not applicable` | each says *"use `REVIEW.md` as the primary review contract"* without naming sections, so each picks up the new section automatically |
| `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` | `Not applicable` | names `REVIEW.md` as the review gate; no section list |
| `.claude/commands/sync-template.md`, `.claude/skills/sync-template.md`, `.cursor/commands/sync-template.md` | `Not applicable` | they list `REVIEW.md` among files the template sync touches; the file is still that file |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` | `Not applicable` | none enumerates `REVIEW.md`'s sections |

### The three Pass-restricted surfaces need one line each

An earlier revision of this plan marked the code-reviewer surfaces
`Not applicable` on the grounds that they name a `Pass` **inside** the Code
checklist rather than the set of checklists. That fact is right and the
conclusion drawn from it was wrong. The instruction is *exclusive* — "evaluate
**only**", "restrict evaluation to" — so on a dispatched implementation review
the new sibling section is not merely unmentioned, it is **excluded**. A
checklist added to the contract that the repository's main code-review path
structurally cannot reach is a declared-but-unwired control, which is precisely
what Core Rules → Verification Discipline exists to prevent.

Add one sentence to each of the three, worded identically so the mirrors stay
byte-comparable:

> When the change under review touches workflow-policy surfaces — `REVIEW.md`,
> the root agent instruction files, `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`, `docs/workflow/**`,
> `docs/best-practices/**`, `scripts/development-workflow/**`, or the per-tool
> instruction trees `.claude/**`, `.cursor/**`, `.codex/**` and `.agents/**` —
> also evaluate the `## Workflow Policy Review Checklist`, in addition to the
> dispatched pass.

"In addition to" keeps the change monotone in the same direction as the rest of
this item: it adds a checklist to a dispatch, never removes the pass. The path
list is the same one the file tier uses, stated in prose because these files
have no code to share.

**Scope note.** This reaches three files the brief does not mention, and it is
recorded rather than absorbed silently. The alternative was to scope the new
checklist as local-reviewer-only and say so in its heading; that keeps the
diff smaller and leaves the contract honest, but it means a human or agent
running the native code review on a workflow-policy PR is told *not* to apply
the one checklist written for it. The three-line version is the smaller
inconsistency. If the boundary should be drawn the other way, reverting is
three sentences and a heading note.

**What the not-applicable rows still rest on, stated as a claim that can fail.**
Every remaining row rests on one fact: no agent or skill file lists the
checklists of `REVIEW.md`. That is the second `grep` above, and it returns
nothing today. If it ever returns a file, that row is wrong — so the implementer
must re-run both searches at implementation time and record the output in the
PR, rather than trusting this table.

## Documentation Updates

- `REVIEW.md` — the new `## Workflow Policy Review Checklist` section.
- `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/local-ai-reviewer.md` — the
  three new bundle fields, the three new evidence keys, the decision table, and
  the statement that a custom command may ignore the stage.
- `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`
  — the `PLATFORM_<n>_REVIEW_STAGE` keys now visible in loop summaries.
- The `--help` block of `local-ai-reviewer.sh`.

All four must describe the same behavior; scenario 9 and runbook Step 8 check
the pair that can drift silently.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A stage selection **narrows** what the reviewer reads | Med | **High** — a defect in an unnamed section produces a confident `clean`, and nothing in any log shows why | Selection is additive by construction: the prompt says "apply `REVIEW.md` in full, including its Core Rules" whenever it names a section, and the file tier unions rather than overrides. Scenario 10 asserts the sentence, and proof **P4** removes it and requires a Core-Rules defect to go unreported |
| A `REVIEW.md` section is renamed and the resolver keeps naming the old heading | **High** — the contract is edited often, including by this item | Med — the prompt names a section that does not exist, and the reviewer falls back to reading everything, which is today's behavior | Scenario 9 greps `REVIEW.md` for every emitted heading string, so a rename fails the suite in the same PR that makes it. Degradation is toward today's behavior, not below it |
| The workflow-policy pattern list drifts from #1652's normative-path list | Med | Low — the two lists answer different questions, but a reader seeing near-duplicates assumes one is stale | Deliberate and recorded: #1652's list answers *may this finding be cleared as cosmetic*, this one answers *which checklist applies*. They overlap but differ on purpose — `docs/specs/developments/**` and `docs/testing/workflow/**` are normative but are the *subject* of the Spec and Plan checklists, and `scripts/development-workflow/**` is shipped code yet is workflow policy. A comment in each names the other and states why they are not shared |
| A custom `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWER_COMMAND` ignores the stage entirely | **High** — it is a free-form command | Low — that command gets today's behavior | Stated in the integration document rather than mitigated. The gate cannot force a third-party command to use the stage; it can only make the stage available in the bundle and the environment, and report which stage it selected. The evidence keys make the omission visible |
| The `default` asymmetry is "fixed" by a later editor | Med | Med — unknown branch types stop behaving as they do today, silently | The asymmetry is a row in the decision table with its rationale beside it, scenario 7 asserts both `default` rows, and proof **P3** plants the "fix" and requires scenario 7 to fail |
| `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` contains a comma or `=` and breaks the line contract | Low | Med — a malformed evidence line | The emitted values are drawn from a fixed, enumerated set of four heading strings, none of which contains a comma or an `=`. Scenario 9 pins the set against `REVIEW.md`; the constraint is stated in the integration document as a rule for anyone adding a fifth |

## Code Samples

The branch tier, and the merge that carries the monotonicity property:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

```bash
# Branch tier. Literal prefixes, never a regex: `specification/foo` must not
# match `spec/*`.
reviewer_stage_for_branch() {
  case "${1:-}" in
    spec/*) printf 'spec\n' ;;
    implementation-plan/*) printf 'plan\n' ;;
    feature/*|refactor/*|fix/*|hotfix/*) printf 'implementation\n' ;;
    *) printf 'default\n' ;;
  esac
}

# File tier. Reads newline-delimited paths on stdin — NOT the JSON array.
# `any`, not `all`: one policy file is enough to add the checklist.
# NOTE: this list is not #1652's reviewer_loop_path_is_normative_document and
# must not be merged with it — that one decides whether a finding may be
# cleared as cosmetic, this one decides which checklist applies. The overlap is
# coincidental, not structural.
reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy() {
  local path
  while IFS= read -r path; do
    [ -n "$path" ] || continue
    case "$path" in
      REVIEW.md|AGENTS.md|CLAUDE.md|GEMINI.md|LLM_RULES.md|.ai-dev-workflow.yaml)
        return 0 ;;
      docs/workflow/*|docs/best-practices/*|scripts/development-workflow/*)
        return 0 ;;
      .claude/*|.cursor/*|.codex/*|.agents/*)
        return 0 ;;
    esac
  done
  return 1
}

# Decode the compact JSON array into newline-delimited paths, buffered.
# NOT `jq ... | predicate`: the script runs under `set -o pipefail` and the
# predicate returns on its first match, so jq would take SIGPIPE on a long
# changed-file list and the failed pipeline would drop the checklist silently.
reviewer_decode_changed_files() {
  local decoded
  if ! decoded="$(printf '%s' "${1:-}" | jq -r '.[]?' 2>/dev/null)"; then
    echo "WARN: could not decode changed_files_json; workflow-policy checklist not applied" >&2
    decoded=""
  fi
  printf '%s\n' "$decoded"
}

# The merge. The file tier only ever appends, and never runs for `default`.
reviewer_resolve_review_stage() {
  # $2 is changed_files_json, the compact JSON array the bundle embeds.
  local head_branch="$1" changed_files_json="$2"
  local stage checklists source

  stage="$(reviewer_stage_for_branch "$head_branch")"
  case "$stage" in
    spec) checklists="Spec Review Checklist" ;;
    plan) checklists="Plan Review Checklist" ;;
    implementation) checklists="Code Review Checklist" ;;
    default) checklists="" ;;
  esac

  source="branch"
  if [ -z "$checklists" ]; then
    source="none"
  elif reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy \
    <<< "$(reviewer_decode_changed_files "$changed_files_json")"; then
    checklists="${checklists},Workflow Policy Review Checklist"
    source="branch+files"
  fi

  printf '%s\n%s\n%s\n' "$stage" "$source" "$checklists"
}
```

The prompt sentence, in `local-codex-review-command.sh`:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

```bash
stage_sentence=""
if [ -n "${REVIEW_CHECKLISTS:-}" ]; then
  stage_sentence="This change is at the ${REVIEW_STAGE:-unknown} stage. Apply REVIEW.md in full, including its Core Rules, and give particular weight to these sections: ${REVIEW_CHECKLISTS}. "
fi
```

`stage_sentence` is prefixed to the built prompt only, never to a
`LOCAL_CODEX_REVIEWER_PROMPT` override.

---

## Planted-Violation Proofs

`REVIEW.md` → Core Rules → Verification Discipline requires two demonstrated
runs per proof, each citing a concrete file and line. The ten proofs fall into
three groups:

| Group | Count | Proofs | What the plant reproduces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Narrowing | **4** | P1, P3, P4, P8 | attention removed from something the reviewer reads today |
| Misclassification | **5** | P2, P5, P6, P9, P10 | the wrong checklist named, or the right one missed |
| Contract | **1** | P7 | the evidence or bundle contract broken |

| # | Violation to plant | Where | Check that must fail, then pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Make the file tier **replace** the branch checklist instead of appending to it | a scratch copy of `reviewer_resolve_review_stage` | scenario 8 fails: an `implementation` branch touching `REVIEW.md` names only Workflow Policy, so the Code checklist is dropped on a PR that changes code. This is the narrowing failure the union exists to prevent; restoring the append passes |
| P2 | Replace the literal `case` prefixes with a substring match | a scratch copy of `reviewer_stage_for_branch` | scenario 2 fails on `specification/foo`, which resolves to `spec` and gets the Spec checklist on a branch that is not a spec branch; restoring the prefix `case` passes |
| P3 | Consult the file tier for stage `default` too | a scratch copy of the merge | scenario 7 fails: an unrecognised branch touching `REVIEW.md` now names a checklist, so its prompt is no longer today's. This is the brief's third scope bullet; restoring the `default` short-circuit passes |
| P4 | Remove "Apply `REVIEW.md` in full, including its Core Rules" from the prompt sentence | a scratch copy of the preset | scenario 10 fails. The sentence is the whole of the additive guarantee: without it the prompt names a section and nothing else, and a Severity or Verification-Discipline violation in Core Rules is outside what the reviewer was told to check; restoring it passes |
| P5 | Change the file tier from `any` to `all` | a scratch copy of the predicate | scenario 4 fails: a PR changing `REVIEW.md` **and** one source file no longer gets the Workflow Policy checklist, which is precisely the mixed change most likely to break a workflow contract; restoring `any` passes |
| P6 | Treat an empty changed-file list as matching | same scratch copy | scenario 5 fails: an unreadable or empty diff adds the policy checklist to every PR, so the signal stops distinguishing anything. Note the direction — this plant is *additive*, and it is still wrong, because a checklist named on every PR is a checklist named on none; restoring the empty-list failure passes |
| P7 | Emit `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` as a **newline-separated** list instead of one line | a scratch copy of the `print_kv` block | scenario 13 fails and shows the break rather than asserting a preference: `emit_prefixed_platform_output` reads its input line by line, so the second checklist becomes its own line and is re-emitted as the key `PLATFORM_1_Workflow Policy Review Checklist` with an empty value — a fabricated key in the loop summary, and the real value truncated to one entry. Restoring the single line passes |
| P10 | Replace the buffered decode with `jq -r '.[]?' \| reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy` | a scratch copy of the merge | scenario 5b fails under `set -o pipefail`: the predicate returns on the first path, `jq` takes SIGPIPE writing the rest, the pipeline reports 141, and the checklist is dropped. The proof is deterministic only because 5b derives its fixture size from this host's own `fs.pipe-max-size` and doubles it, so the plant cannot pass by fitting in a buffer on a machine whose ceiling was raised. Scenario 5a still passes on its two-path list, which is the point: the plant is invisible to any test that stays under the buffer; restoring the buffered decode passes both |
| P9 | Drop the `jq -r '.[]?'` decode and pipe `changed_files_json` straight into the predicate | a scratch copy of the merge | scenario 5a fails: the compact array `["REVIEW.md","src/app/main.ts"]` arrives as one line matching no `case` arm, so the Workflow Policy checklist is never added on any PR. The predicate's own tests still pass, and so does every merge test that stubs the file tier — this is only visible where the two meet; restoring the decode passes |
| P8 | Rename `## Code Review Checklist` in `REVIEW.md` without touching the resolver | a scratch copy of the contract | scenario 9 fails, because the resolver emits a heading that no longer exists. Without this proof the feature degrades silently — the prompt names a missing section and the reviewer falls back to reading everything, which looks like success; restoring the heading passes |

Four proofs plant the **narrowing** direction, which is the one with no
observable symptom, and each is required: P1 drops a checklist through the
merge, P3 drops the `default` guarantee, P4 drops the additive sentence, and P8
drops the link between the resolver and the contract. P6 is worth reading
twice — it plants an *over*-selection and is still a defect, because the
Workflow Policy checklist named on every PR carries no information.

---

## Implementation Order

1. Add `## Workflow Policy Review Checklist` to `REVIEW.md`, after
   `## Code Review Checklist`. **Verify**: the section exists, has six numbered
   questions, and the four heading strings the resolver will emit are all
   present as level-2 headings — the grep scenario 9 will run.
1a. Add the harness guard, copied from `pr-review-loop.sh` lines 12-19, wrapping
   the argument block. **Verify**: scenario 0 — sourced defines the functions,
   direct execution with `HARNESS_MODE=1` still exits 2.
2. Add `reviewer_stage_for_branch` and
   `reviewer_changed_files_touch_workflow_policy` to `local-ai-reviewer.sh`.
   **Verify**: scenarios 1 through 5, including the `specification/foo` control
   and the empty-list case. The predicate's contract is newline-delimited stdin;
   the JSON decode belongs to step 3.
3. Add `reviewer_resolve_review_stage` and call it after `changed_files_json` is
   built and before the bundle is written. **Verify**: scenarios 5a, 5b, 6, 7 and 8 — the buffered decode against a real
   `changed_files_json` value, the host-derived oversized list that exposes a
   pipeline decode, all eight rows of the decision table, both
   `default` rows empty, and the Code-before-Workflow-Policy order.
4. Add the three fields to the context bundle, leaving `schema_version` at
   `local_ai_reviewer_context.v1`. **Verify**: scenario 12, field by field
   against the enumerated thirteen.
5. Add the three `print_kv` calls and the `review_stage` object in
   `write_evidence_file`. **Verify**: scenarios 13 and 14, the first through the
   real `emit_prefixed_platform_output`.
6. Export `REVIEW_STAGE`, `REVIEW_STAGE_SOURCE` and `REVIEW_CHECKLISTS` to the
   command, and add the stage sentence to the preset. **Verify**: scenarios 10,
   11, 15 and 15a — the sentence's wording, the byte-identical `default`
   prompt, the override, and all three variables present in the command's
   environment.
6a. Add the identical workflow-policy sentence to `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`,
   `.cursor/agents/code-reviewer.md` and
   `.codex/skills/workflow-code-reviewer/SKILL.md`. **Verify**: scenario 8a —
   present in all three and byte-identical across them.
7. Re-run the two searches in **Cross-Cutting Checklist Classification** and
   record their output in the PR. If the checklist-enumeration search returns
   anything, stop and revise the plan. Then update the `--help` block, the
   integration document and Protocol 93.
   **Verify**: runbook Step 8 reads all four surfaces against each other.
8. Produce the ten planted-violation proofs (P1-P10) and record them in the PR
   with the command, file, line and both outcomes for each.

---

## Rollback

Revert the implementation PR. The change is additive: three bundle fields, three
evidence keys, one prompt sentence and one `REVIEW.md` section. Reverting
restores the stage-agnostic prompt for every branch type, and no other script
reads the new keys.
