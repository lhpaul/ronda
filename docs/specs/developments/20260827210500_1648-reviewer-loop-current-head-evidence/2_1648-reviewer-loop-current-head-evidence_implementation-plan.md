# Reviewer Loop Current-Head Evidence — Implementation Plan

## Summary

**Approach**: `local-ai-reviewer.sh` already emits `REVIEWED_HEAD`, and
`pr-review-loop.sh` already forwards it as `PLATFORM_<n>_REVIEWED_HEAD`, but no
consumer surface keeps it: the reviewer-loop summary comment never prints it,
the `reviewer_loop_history.v1` ledger entry records only one loop-level
`head_sha`, and `item-completion-self-check.sh` accepts any clean summary text
without checking which commit it described. This plan threads the value through
those three surfaces: capture reviewed heads per platform in the loop, render a
`Head evidence` block plus a `reviewed_heads[]` ledger field that marks each
reviewer `current`, `not-current`, or `not-reported`, export three aggregate
keys — `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED`, `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWED_HEAD`, and
`LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` — on the loop's key=value contract and carry them into
the readiness checklist, and make a stale local clean result block
`ready-for-human-review`
through the existing readiness checklist and ground-truth self-check.

**Estimated complexity**: M

**Rationale**: The data already exists and flows to the boundary of the loop, so
no new reviewer integration is needed. The work is concentrated in one large
script (`pr-review-loop.sh`), one self-check script, two protocol documents, and
their harnesses — a handful of files, but each on a surface where a readiness
gate is enforced, so the tests carry more weight than the edits.

**Dependencies**: None. This is the first item of epic #1647 and no sibling
item's PR is merged. Later siblings (#1649, #1651, #1652, #1656) consume the
`reviewed_heads[]` ledger field this item introduces.

## Verification Log

| Check | Command / query | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo revision | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` | `7998d43d` |
| `REVIEWED_HEAD` producers | `grep -rn "REVIEWED_HEAD" scripts/development-workflow/*.sh \| awk -F: '{print $1}' \| sort \| uniq -c` | 3 in `local-ai-reviewer.sh`, 4 in `pr-review-loop.sh`; no other script |
| Which loop reviewer emits it | `awk '/^run_[a-z_]*_review(_review)?\(\)/{fn=$1} /print_kv REVIEWED_HEAD/{print fn}' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh \| sort \| uniq -c` | 4 occurrences, all inside `run_local_ai_reviewer_review()` — one per exit-code branch (clean, needs_fixes, escalate, skipped) |
| Forwarding to loop stdout | `grep -n -A20 "^emit_prefixed_platform_output()" scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Every key except `RESULT`/`PR_NUMBER`/`BRANCH`/`FIX_AGENT`/`PLATFORM` is re-emitted as `PLATFORM_<n>_<KEY>`, so `PLATFORM_<n>_REVIEWED_HEAD` is already on stdout |
| Ledger entry fields | `grep -n "head_sha:" scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Single hit at line 6929 inside `reviewer_loop_history_build_entry`; no per-platform reviewed head is stored |
| Ledger head source | `sed -n '6843,6866p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `reviewer_loop_history_current_head_sha` reads `gh pr view --json headRefOid`, i.e. the live PR head at write time, not the head any reviewer read |
| Summary comment sections | `sed -n '9013,9022p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Body interpolates `small_findings_section`, `phase_section`, `compare_section`, `advisory_section`, `advisory_checks_section`, `regression_label_section` — no head-evidence section exists |
| Self-check review row | `grep -n "pull_request.review_summary" scripts/development-workflow/item-completion-self-check.sh` | Rows added at lines 701–716; the verified branch only tests the summary text for `Result: clean\|skipped`, never a SHA |
| Existing head conditions in Protocol 92 | `grep -n "POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA" docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/92-pr-readiness-signal-protocol.md` | Present for the aggregate post-clean settle only; no condition names a per-reviewer reviewed head |
| Reviewed head is a full OID | `grep -n 'HEAD_SHA=' scripts/development-workflow/local-ai-reviewer.sh` and `grep -n 'print_kv REVIEWED_HEAD' scripts/development-workflow/local-ai-reviewer.sh` | `HEAD_SHA` is set from `gh pr view --json headRefOid` (line 237) and printed verbatim as `REVIEWED_HEAD` (line 369) — the reviewer emits the full 40-character OID, never an abbreviation |
| Current head is the same field | `sed -n '8515,8521p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `loop_head_sha` is read from `gh pr view --json headRefOid` before any reviewer is dispatched, so both sides of the comparison come from the same GitHub field |
| Harness entry point | `grep -n "HARNESS_MODE=1 source" scripts/development-workflow/tests/*.sh` | `test-pr-review-loop.sh` and `test-local-ai-reviewer-pr-review-loop-dispatch.sh` both source the loop with `HARNESS_MODE=1`, so new pure functions are unit-testable without network access |
| Suite selection | `head -40 scripts/development-workflow/select-test-suites.sh` | Suites declare coverage with `# covers:` headers; no `.github/workflows` edit is needed to wire a new or edited suite |

## Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check

### Applicable

| Assumption surface | Recorded value | Authoritative source | Verified at | Bounded cross-check scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approved base branch for this item | `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` | `integration-branch:internal-reviewer-effectiveness` label on #1648; Protocol 91 § Integration-branch base override | 2026-08-27, repo SHA `7998d43d` | Epic #1647 items #1648–#1657 only; no other open PR targets this base | `Resolved` |
| Reviewer-loop ledger schema identifier | `reviewer_loop_history.v1` | `REVIEWER_LOOP_HISTORY_SCHEMA` in `pr-review-loop.sh` | 2026-08-27, repo SHA `7998d43d` | Reader paths in `pr-review-loop.sh` and `run-epic-*` helpers | `Verified` |

Resolution note for the base branch row: the run-epic scope resolver reported
`baseBranch=develop` with the warning *"integration branch
develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness ... was not found on origin; using
develop"*. The branch was missing only because no sibling had created it yet.
All ten epic items carry the same integration-branch label (not a partial or
mixed set), so Protocol 91 § Integration-branch base override step 4 applies:
the branch was created from `origin/develop` and pushed before any item branch,
and `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` is the approved base for this PR.

The ledger schema row stays `v1`: this plan only adds optional fields, and every
reader dereferences ledger fields with `// ""` or `// []` defaults, so an entry
written before this change still parses.

## Layer-by-Layer Changes

### Backend / API

Not applicable — this repository ships workflow tooling, not a service.

### Shared Packages / Libraries

`scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` (shell contract: `bash`; the
file declares `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and uses Bash arrays):

- [ ] Add a `platform_reviewed_heads` associative-style parallel array
      (`platform_reviewed_heads+=("${platform_name}:${_reviewed_head}")`)
      alongside the existing `platform_result_tokens` accumulation in the
      per-platform block, populated from
      `kv_value_default REVIEWED_HEAD "$platform_output" ""`. Reviewers that do
      not report a reviewed head record the empty string and are rendered as
      `not-reported`, which is distinct from `not-current`.
- [ ] **Reuse the existing pre-dispatch snapshot — do not add a second lookup.**
      `loop_head_sha` is already captured from
      `gh pr view --json headRefOid` before any reviewer is dispatched
      (`pr-review-loop.sh`, the block introduced by issue #1574), and it is
      already the value the settle emits as `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA`. Every
      consumer added by this plan — the summary block, the ledger field, and
      the three stdout keys — classifies against `loop_head_sha` and nothing
      else. No new `gh` call is introduced, so there is no window in which two
      adjacent lookups could observe different commits and produce
      contradictory per-reviewer and aggregate evidence. Re-reading the live
      head inside any renderer is explicitly out of bounds.
- [ ] **Reconciliation with the ledger's own `head_sha`.** The ledger's
      existing `head_sha` keeps its current source
      (`reviewer_loop_history_current_head_sha`, read at write time): it is the
      identity key both #1502 cap counters bucket on, and re-pointing it would
      change cap accounting, which is outside this item's scope. Instead the
      entry gains `classification_head`, set to `loop_head_sha`, so a reader can
      see exactly which snapshot the `reviewed_heads[]` states were computed
      against and can detect the case where the head moved between dispatch and
      write time. The two fields being equal is the normal case; them differing
      is the head-moved case the existing guard at the end of the loop already
      turns into `needs_fixes` / `head_moved_during_run`.
- [ ] When the pre-dispatch lookup fails, `loop_head_sha` is the empty string
      (its existing documented behavior — the loop already warns that
      `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA` will be empty and Protocol 91 Check 0.6 will refuse
      the verdict). **Precedence is the classifier's step order, which is
      authoritative wherever this plan describes an outcome**: the reviewed head
      is examined first, so a platform that reported *no* head stays
      `not-reported` even when the current head is also empty, and only a
      platform that *did* report a head classifies
      `not-current|unverifiable_current_head`. Both outcomes are blocking —
      `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` is `0` in the second case and empty in the first,
      and the fail-closed readiness rule refuses both — so the empty
      `loop_head_sha` path is fail-closed either way, aligned with the refusal
      Check 0.6 already performs for the same cause. The
      synthetic `unknown-<epoch>-<pid>-<rand>` placeholder never reaches this
      path, because it is produced by `reviewer_loop_history_current_head_sha`
      for the ledger's `head_sha`, not by the pre-dispatch capture; it is still
      covered as an edge case so the predicate rejects it if a future caller
      passes it in.
- [ ] Add pure predicate `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha <value>`
      returning success only when the value matches `^[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$`.
      **No prefix or abbreviation matching is performed anywhere in this
      feature.** A shared 7-character prefix does not prove two values name the
      same commit — abbreviation uniqueness is a repository-scoped property that
      a fixed minimum length does not establish — and the reviewer this gate
      exists for already emits the full OID: `local-ai-reviewer.sh` sets
      `HEAD_SHA` from `gh pr view --json headRefOid` and prints it verbatim as
      `REVIEWED_HEAD`, and the loop's own `loop_head_sha` comes from the same
      field. Full equality is therefore both the safe rule and the one that
      matches the data actually produced.
- [ ] Add pure function `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify <reviewed_head>
      <current_head>` printing `<state>` or `<state>|<reason>`, where state is
      one of `current`, `not-current`, or `not-reported`, in this deterministic
      order:
      1. Reviewed head empty → `not-reported`.
      2. Reviewed head fails `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha` →
         `not-current|unverifiable_reviewed_head`. A truncated, abbreviated,
         non-hex, or over-length value is not evidence of currency, and the
         reason distinguishes it from a genuine mismatch so the summary does not
         imply the reviewer read a different commit.
      3. Current head fails `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha` →
         `not-current|unverifiable_current_head`. This is the empty
         `loop_head_sha` path (failed pre-dispatch read) and the synthetic
         placeholder path.
      4. Both are full SHAs → compare for **exact case-insensitive equality**;
         `current` when equal, `not-current|head_mismatch` otherwise.
      Case-insensitive comparison is deliberate — `headRefOid` is lowercase, and
      a reviewer that echoes an uppercase OID is naming the same commit. Every
      non-`current` outcome is fail-closed: `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` is `0` for
      all three reasons, so no unverifiable value can produce a passing
      readiness signal.
- [ ] Add pure function `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_render <current_head>
      <entries…>` producing the Markdown `**Head evidence:**` block, one row per
      platform carrying its state and, for `not-current`, its reason, and
      interpolate it into the summary comment body immediately before
      `${phase_section}`.
- [ ] Add pure function `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_json <current_head>
      <entries…>` producing the `reviewed_heads` array, whose elements carry
      `platform`, `reviewed_head`, `state`, and `reason`, and thread it into
      `reviewer_loop_history_build_entry` as a new `--argjson reviewedHeads`
      parameter following the existing `current_run_id` convention (set by the
      caller in a global, not appended to the positional list).
- [ ] Emit three new top-level key=value pairs on the loop's stdout contract
      next to the existing aggregate keys, **always, on every run**:
      - `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` — `1` when `local-ai-reviewer` is in the resolved
        platform list, `0` when it is not. This is the applicability signal.
      - `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWED_HEAD` — the reviewed head reported by that platform;
        empty when it is not configured or reported none.
      - `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` — `1` when the classification is `current`, `0`
        when `not-current`, empty when `not-reported` or not configured.

      Applicability is carried by `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED`, **never by the absence
      of a key**. An absent key means the telemetry did not reach the consumer,
      which is a fail-closed condition, not a pass. All three values stay within
      the `[A-Za-z0-9:_-]` token charset the Protocol 91 carry-forward snippet
      already admits — a 40-character hex OID included — so no pattern widening
      is needed for them.
- [ ] Document all three new keys in the `--help` usage block, naming
      `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` as the applicability signal, so the contract stays
      discoverable from the script itself.

`scripts/development-workflow/item-completion-self-check.sh` (shell contract:
`bash`):

- [ ] Add a `pull_request.local_reviewer_head` row derived from the newest
      reviewer-loop summary comment. The configured/unconfigured split is what
      decides optional vs. required — a pre-field ledger entry must **not** be
      treated as optional, because that is exactly the stale-verdict hole this
      item closes:

      | Condition | Status |
      | --- | --- |
      | Ledger's newest entry records the `local-ai-reviewer` reviewed head equal to the live `headRefOid` | `verified` |
      | It records a different SHA | `discrepancy` |
      | Platform is configured and review evidence is required, but the entry has no `reviewed_heads` field (pre-field ledger) | `unavailable_required` |
      | Platform is configured and review evidence is required, but the ledger is unreadable | `unavailable_required` |
      | `local-ai-reviewer` is not in the resolved platform list | `unavailable_optional` |
      | Review evidence is not required for this terminal claim (`--require-review-summary` not set) | `unavailable_optional` |

      An `unavailable_required` result keeps the item non-terminal, which is the
      existing contract stated in Protocol 92 § Readiness Labels and Report
      Evidence. Re-running Step 7 on the live head writes a ledger entry with
      the field and clears the row.
- [ ] Keep the existing `pull_request.review_summary` row unchanged so the new
      row is additive evidence rather than a redefinition of an existing one.

### Frontend / UI

Not applicable — no user interface in this repository.

### Infrastructure / Configuration

- [ ] No `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` change. The behavior keys off whether
      `local-ai-reviewer` appears in the resolved platform list, which the loop
      already computes.

### Documentation

- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/92-pr-readiness-signal-protocol.md`
      — add one **fail-closed** bullet under *Conditions for
      `ready-for-human-review`*: when `local-ai-reviewer` is in the resolved
      platform list and Step 7 returned `clean`, `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` must
      be exactly `1`. Both other values block the label: `0` is positive
      not-current evidence, and an empty value means the reviewer ran but
      reported no head at all, which is missing evidence — and missing evidence
      is not a pass. Either way the label waits until Step 7 is re-run on the
      live head. Applicability is read from `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED`: `0` means the
      platform is not in the resolved list and the condition does not apply;
      an unset `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` means the loop's telemetry never reached
      the checklist and is itself blocking, so an absent key is never a pass.
- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`
      — three coordinated edits, because emitting the keys is not enough on its
      own: the Step 7 carry-forward snippet currently unsets and greps only
      `POST_CLEAN_*`, so without the first edit the new keys never reach the
      checklist and the gate would silently never fire.
      1. **Carry-forward snippet** (§ "Carry the settle verdict forward"):
         widen the unset loop and the grep to
         `^(POST_CLEAN|LOCAL_AI)_[A-Z_]*` and
         `^(POST_CLEAN|LOCAL_AI)_[A-Z_]+=[A-Za-z0-9:_-]*$` respectively, so the
         three new keys are cleared and re-exported on exactly the same
         lifecycle as the settle fields. The surrounding contract is unchanged:
         cleared before the run, exported only on a zero exit, belonging to the
         latest HEAD only.
      2. **Check 0.6** (exit 12): add the local-reviewer condition next to the
         existing `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA` one, evaluated in this order —
         `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` unset → fail closed with "reviewer-loop telemetry
         was not carried forward; re-run Step 7 and export its `POST_CLEAN_*`
         and `LOCAL_AI_*` fields"; `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=0` → condition not
         applicable, continue; `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=1` and
         `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` not exactly `1` → refuse the label and re-run
         Step 7 on the live head. Extend the exit-12 row of the exit-code table
         to name the new cause.
      3. **Work Item Runner summary**: add a reviewed-head row reporting
         `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED`, `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWED_HEAD`, and
         `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`.

---

## Testing Strategy

**Test types**: Unit (shell harness), plus the smoke test runbook.

**Key scenarios to test**:

1. `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify` returns the required state — and
   reason where the table names one — for every row of the parser-risk
   edge-case table. Maps to brief scope bullets 1 and 2, and is the regression
   coverage for the full-OID equality rule and its three failure reasons.
2. `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha` accepts a 40-char hex value and
   rejects a 39-char value, a 41-char value, a 7-char abbreviation, a 40-char
   value containing a non-hex character, and the empty string — pins full-OID
   equality as an enforced rule rather than a comment.
3. All consumers classify against the single pre-dispatch `loop_head_sha`
   snapshot: with `gh pr view --json headRefOid` mocked to return a *different*
   SHA on every call, one loop iteration still produces the same current head
   and the same per-platform classification in the rendered block, the ledger
   entry, and `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` — fails if any renderer issues its own
   lookup instead of reading `loop_head_sha`.
4. The ledger entry's `classification_head` equals the `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA`
   emitted by the same run — pins the reconciliation between the new per-reviewer
   evidence and the existing aggregate head evidence, so the two cannot drift
   apart silently.
5. `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_render` prints one row per platform carrying
   that platform's state, and its reason when the state is `not-current`, and
   prints the current PR head exactly once — scope bullet 1.
6. `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_json` emits a `reviewed_heads` array whose
   entries carry `platform`, `reviewed_head`, `state`, and `reason` (empty
   string when the state is `current` or `not-reported`), and an empty array
   when no platform is configured — supports #1651 and #1657 downstream.
7. A ledger entry written without `reviewed_heads` or `classification_head`
   still parses through `reviewer_loop_history_payload_from_existing` —
   backward compatibility of the `v1` schema.
8. `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT=0` is emitted when the local reviewer's reviewed head
   differs from `loop_head_sha` — scope bullet 3 (block readiness claims on a
   stale local clean result).
9. With `local-ai-reviewer` configured but reporting no reviewed head, the loop
   emits `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=1` and `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT=` (present, empty) —
   the fail-closed "missing evidence" state that must block readiness, distinct
   from scenario 10.
10. With `local-ai-reviewer` absent from the resolved platform list, the loop
    emits `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=0` — the "condition not applicable" state, and
    the automated coverage for the downstream-consumer compatibility mitigation
    in the risk table. All three keys are emitted on every run, so applicability
    never depends on a key being absent.
11. `item-completion-self-check.sh` fills `pull_request.local_reviewer_head`
    with the expected status for **each of the six rows** of its condition
    table, one case per row: `verified` (ledger head equals the live
    `headRefOid`); `discrepancy` (ledger head differs); `unavailable_required`
    for a pre-field ledger with the platform configured and review evidence
    required; `unavailable_required` for an unreadable ledger under the same
    conditions; `unavailable_optional` when `local-ai-reviewer` is not in the
    resolved platform list; and `unavailable_optional` when
    `--require-review-summary` is not set — scope bullet 3 at the
    report-evidence layer.
12. The Protocol 91 carry-forward snippet, run against a captured loop output,
    exports all three `LOCAL_AI_*` keys into the environment, and clears them
    before the next invocation exactly as it clears `POST_CLEAN_*` — this is the
    regression test for the gap where the keys are emitted but never reach
    Check 0.6, which would make the whole gate silently inert.

**Files**:

- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` — scenarios 1–7,
  added as new cases in the existing `HARNESS_MODE=1` harness.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-local-ai-reviewer-pr-review-loop-dispatch.sh`
  — scenarios 8, 9, and 10, next to the existing dispatch assertions.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-item-completion-self-check.sh` —
  scenario 11, one case per row of the six-condition table.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` — scenario 12,
  which requires **two** `# covers:` header lines on that suite:

  ```text
  # covers: scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh
  # covers: docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md
  ```

  Both are mandatory. In `select-test-suites.sh`, the naming-convention
  fallback runs only when a suite declares nothing (`declared=0`); the first
  `# covers:` line sets `declared=1` and disables it. Adding the protocol line
  alone would therefore *drop* this suite's implicit coverage of
  `pr-review-loop.sh` — the primary loop suite would stop running when the loop
  script changes, which is strictly worse than the gap it was meant to close.
  The script line restores explicitly what the convention supplied implicitly.

Coverage declarations: the dispatch suite and the self-check suite already
declare or imply coverage of the changed scripts and need no edit.
`test-pr-review-loop.sh` currently relies on the naming convention, which is why
it needs both lines above rather than one — see the note there.

### Planted-violation proofs (mandatory before `ready-for-human-review`)

This plan adds a new automated readiness check — the Check 0.6 local-reviewer
condition — so `REVIEW.md` § Planted-violation proof and
`docs/best-practices/3-testing.md` § Planted-Violation Proofs apply. The
negative unit cases above are necessary but not sufficient: they prove the
classifier's return values, not that the *gate* refuses a PR. The implementation
PR must include two demonstrated runs per proof, each citing a concrete file and
line, showing the check failing with the violation planted and passing once it
is removed. The exemption for pure refactors of already-proven logic does not
apply — this is a new control.

| # | Violation to plant | Where | Check that must fail, then pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | A stale local clean result: ledger's newest `reviewed_heads` entry for `local-ai-reviewer` records a 40-character OID that is not the live `headRefOid`, with `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=1` | the `pull_request.local_reviewer_head` fixture in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-item-completion-self-check.sh` | the self-check reports `discrepancy` and the section is non-terminal; removing the violation (matching OIDs) reports `verified` |
| P2 | Missing head evidence: `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=1` with `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` present and empty | the Check 0.6 fixture in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` | Check 0.6 exits 12 and refuses `ready-for-human-review`; setting `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT=1` exits 0 |
| P3 | Telemetry loss: `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` unset in the checklist environment while the loop reported `clean` | same fixture as P2 | Check 0.6 exits 12 with the carry-forward message; exporting the key restores exit 0 — this is the proof that an absent key is not silently treated as "not applicable" |
| P4 | Carry-forward regression: revert the unset loop's `grep -oE` to `grep -o` in a scratch copy of the Protocol 91 snippet | the snippet fixture used by scenario 12 in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` | the clearing assertion fails because stale keys survive; restoring `-E` passes — this is the proof for the Bugbot finding that motivated the `-E` |
| P5 | Coverage regression: remove the `# covers: scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` line from `test-pr-review-loop.sh` in a scratch copy | run `scripts/development-workflow/select-test-suites.sh` against a change set touching only `pr-review-loop.sh` | the suite is **not** selected; restoring the line selects it — the proof for the `declared=1` fallback risk |

Record all five in the implementation PR description under a
`Planted-Violation Proofs` heading, each with the command run, the file and line
of the planted violation, and the two outcomes. A proof that shows only the
passing direction does not satisfy the rule.

**Smoke test runbook**:
`docs/testing/workflow/1648-reviewer-loop-current-head-evidence.smoke-test.md`

**Regression suite**: The repository's regression surface is the
`workflow-tests.yml` harness selection described above; the three suites listed
are the regression coverage for this change. No separate regression spec exists
to update.

### Parser-risk addendum

Applicable — `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify` compares two
externally-supplied strings and normalizes length.

- **Edge-case enumeration**, each with its required classification:

  | Reviewed head | Current head | Required result | Why |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 40-char SHA | same 40-char SHA | `current` | exact match — the only passing case |
  | uppercase 40-char SHA | same SHA lowercase | `current` | same commit, different casing |
  | 40-char SHA | different 40-char SHA | `not-current` / `head_mismatch` | genuine mismatch |
  | 7-char abbreviation | 40-char SHA sharing the prefix | `not-current` / `unverifiable_reviewed_head` | a shared prefix does not prove identity; this is the negative case for the abbreviation-uniqueness finding |
  | 39-char hex string | 40-char SHA sharing the prefix | `not-current` / `unverifiable_reviewed_head` | one below full length — pins the boundary, not just a value far from it |
  | 41-char hex string | 40-char SHA sharing the prefix | `not-current` / `unverifiable_reviewed_head` | longer than an OID; rejected rather than truncated |
  | 40 chars with one non-hex character | 40-char SHA | `not-current` / `unverifiable_reviewed_head` | correct length but not hex |
  | `""` (empty) | 40-char SHA | `not-reported` | reviewer reported nothing; distinct from a mismatch |
  | 40-char SHA | `""` (empty) | `not-current` / `unverifiable_current_head` | failed pre-dispatch read of `loop_head_sha` |
  | 40-char SHA | `unknown-1756330000-4821-19342` | `not-current` / `unverifiable_current_head` | synthetic placeholder is non-hex and not 40 chars |

- **Unit test mapping**: each row above gets one case in
  `test-pr-review-loop.sh`, asserting the exact state and reason in the
  "Required result" column. The abbreviation, 39-char, 41-char, non-hex, empty
  and placeholder rows are the negative tests that keep an unverifiable value
  from manufacturing a passing readiness signal.
- **Suppression semantics**: not applicable — no suppression directives.

### Concurrent-event-source addendum

Not applicable. The loop is a single sequential process; the new functions are
pure and hold no state across invocations. The only shared mutable state is the
existing `platform_*` accumulation arrays, written in the same sequential
per-platform block that already writes `platform_result_tokens`.

## Seed Data

| Entity | Values / Scenario | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ledger fixture without `reviewed_heads` or `classification_head` | A `reviewer_loop_history.v1` payload with one entry that predates this change, to prove backward compatibility (scenario 7) | inline heredoc in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Ledger fixture with a stale local head | Newest entry recording a `local-ai-reviewer` reviewed head that differs from the 40-character OID the mocked `gh pr view` returns (scenario 11) | inline mock in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-item-completion-self-check.sh` |
| Ledger fixture with no `reviewed_heads` field, platform configured | Same payload as the first row, evaluated with `--require-review-summary true` and `local-ai-reviewer` in the resolved list, to pin `unavailable_required` (scenario 11) | inline mock in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-item-completion-self-check.sh` |

No repository fixture files are added; both suites already build their fixtures
inline with mock `gh` commands and require no network access.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/92-pr-readiness-signal-protocol.md`
      — add the `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` condition under *Conditions for
      `ready-for-human-review`*.
- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`
      — enforce the same condition in the readiness checklist alongside
      `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA`, and add the reviewed-head row to the Work Item
      Runner summary fields.
- [ ] `REVIEW.md` — no change. The reviewed-head signal is produced by the loop,
      not asserted by a reviewer against the review contract.
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — no change. It does not enumerate reviewer-loop output keys.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A partial match is mistaken for proof that two values name the same commit | Med | High — it would defeat the gate this item exists to build | No prefix or abbreviation matching exists anywhere in the feature: `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha` requires a full 40-character hex OID on both sides and the comparison is exact case-insensitive equality. Both producers already emit `headRefOid` in full, so nothing legitimate is rejected; the abbreviation, 39-char, 41-char, and non-hex rows of the edge-case table are the negative tests |
| A failed live-head lookup leaves classification without a usable current head | Med | Med — could produce a confusing verdict or, if mishandled, a false `current` | Classification reads `loop_head_sha`, which is the **empty string** when the pre-dispatch lookup fails; the empty value fails `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha`, so any platform that reported a head classifies `not-current` / `unverifiable_current_head` and one that reported none stays `not-reported` — both blocking. The synthetic `unknown-…` placeholder belongs to a different code path (`reviewer_loop_history_current_head_sha`, which supplies the ledger's own `head_sha`) and never reaches classification; it is still an edge-case row so the predicate rejects it if a future caller passes it in |
| The summary block, the ledger entry, and the stdout keys classify against different snapshots of the live head | Med | High — the three surfaces would contradict each other, and per-reviewer evidence could disagree with `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA` | No new lookup is added: all consumers read the existing pre-dispatch `loop_head_sha`, the same value the settle emits as `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA`; scenario 3 fails if any renderer issues its own lookup, and scenario 4 pins `classification_head` equal to `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA` |
| Adding fields to `reviewer_loop_history.v1` breaks a reader that validates the entry shape | Low | High — a broken ledger read is fail-closed and would stall every reviewer loop | `reviewed_heads` and `classification_head` are additive and optional; scenario 7 asserts an entry without either still parses through `reviewer_loop_history_payload_from_existing` |
| The new readiness condition blocks PRs in repositories that do not configure `local-ai-reviewer` | Low | High — it would stall downstream consumers of this template | Applicability is read from `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED`, which the loop emits on every run: `0` means the platform is not in the resolved list and Check 0.6 continues without evaluating the head condition. Scenario 10 asserts `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=0` for a non-configuring repository, and scenario 9 pins the separate configured-but-no-head state that *does* block |
| The keys are emitted but never reach Check 0.6, leaving the gate inert | Med | High — the item would appear complete while changing nothing about readiness | The carry-forward snippet is widened in the same edit that adds the Check 0.6 condition, with `grep -oE` on the unset loop so the alternation actually matches; scenario 12 exports a captured loop output through the snippet and asserts all three keys arrive and are cleared, and the two `# covers:` lines make a later snippet edit re-run that suite |
| Adding a `# covers:` line silently drops the suite's naming-convention coverage | Med | High — the primary loop suite would stop running when `pr-review-loop.sh` changes, and CI would still be green | `select-test-suites.sh` applies the fallback only when `declared=0`, so the plan requires **both** `# covers:` lines on `test-pr-review-loop.sh` and records why |
| The summary comment grows past what reviewers read | Low | Low | The head-evidence block is one line per configured platform plus one current-head line, in the same style as the existing compare-mode block |

## Code Samples

```bash
# Illustrative — adapt during implementation.

# A value is usable head evidence only when it is a full 40-character hex OID.
# No abbreviation or prefix matching: a shared prefix does not prove two values
# name the same commit, and both producers already emit the full headRefOid.
reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha() {
  local value="$1"
  case "$value" in
    ''|*[!0-9a-fA-F]*) return 1 ;;
  esac
  [ "${#value}" -eq 40 ]
}

# Classify one reviewer's reviewed head against the pre-dispatch loop_head_sha.
# Prints "<state>" or "<state>|<reason>". Every non-current outcome is
# fail-closed: LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT is 0 for all of them.
reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify() {
  local reviewed="$1"
  local current="$2"

  if [ -z "$reviewed" ]; then
    printf 'not-reported\n'
    return 0
  fi
  if ! reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha "$reviewed"; then
    printf 'not-current|unverifiable_reviewed_head\n'
    return 0
  fi
  if ! reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha "$current"; then
    printf 'not-current|unverifiable_current_head\n'
    return 0
  fi

  reviewed="$(printf '%s' "$reviewed" | tr 'A-F' 'a-f')"
  current="$(printf '%s' "$current" | tr 'A-F' 'a-f')"

  if [ "$reviewed" = "$current" ]; then
    printf 'current\n'
  else
    printf 'not-current|head_mismatch\n'
  fi
}
```

Rendered summary block, illustrative:

```markdown
**Head evidence:** current PR head `82d2f3a844a6c0c417f5c55e8a01eebdf343de45`

- local-ai-reviewer: reviewed `82d2f3a844a6c0c417f5c55e8a01eebdf343de45` — current
- pr-agent: reviewed `29c0e9d2541a85c0e335052de42599f485d51a67` — not-current (head_mismatch)
- codex-github: not-reported
```

Full OIDs are printed rather than abbreviations, matching the comparison rule:
the block shows exactly the values that were compared, so a reader can verify
the verdict without resolving an abbreviation.

## Implementation Order

1. Add the four pure helpers (`reviewer_loop_head_evidence_full_sha`,
   `…_classify`, `…_render`, `…_json`) to
   `scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` near the existing
   `reviewer_loop_history_*` helpers. **Verify**: source the script with
   `HARNESS_MODE=1` and call each function directly; confirm every row of the
   parser-risk edge-case table returns its required state and reason.
2. Populate `platform_reviewed_heads` in the per-platform result block next to
   the existing `platform_result_tokens+=(...)` line, and classify each entry
   against the existing pre-dispatch `loop_head_sha` — do not add a lookup.
   **Verify**: run the dispatch suite and confirm the array is populated for a
   mocked `local-ai-reviewer` run, and that mocking `gh pr view --json
   headRefOid` to change on every call does not change the classification.
3. Interpolate the `**Head evidence:**` block into the summary comment body
   before `${phase_section}`. **Verify**: run the harness case that builds the
   comment body and read the output; confirm the block appears once, with one
   row per configured platform.
4. Thread `reviewed_heads` and `classification_head` into
   `reviewer_loop_history_build_entry` via caller-set globals, following the
   `current_run_id` convention already documented in that function. Leave the
   existing `head_sha` field and its source untouched. **Verify**: build an
   entry in the harness and pipe it through `jq` to confirm the array shape and
   that `classification_head` equals the run's `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA`.
5. Emit `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED`, `LOCAL_AI_REVIEWED_HEAD`, and
   `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` on the loop's stdout contract on every run, and
   document all three in `--help` including which key carries applicability and
   the `1` / `0` / empty contract for `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`. **Verify**: run
   `pr-review-loop.sh --help` and confirm all three keys and their states are
   described.
6. Add the `pull_request.local_reviewer_head` row to
   `scripts/development-workflow/item-completion-self-check.sh`. **Verify**: run
   the self-check suite and read the emitted Markdown section; confirm the row
   appears with the expected status for each mocked ledger.
7. Update
   `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/92-pr-readiness-signal-protocol.md`
   and
   `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`
   per **Documentation Updates** — the carry-forward snippet widening, the
   Check 0.6 condition, the exit-12 table row, and the runner-summary row must
   land together; the Check 0.6 condition without the snippet widening is an
   inert gate. **Verify**: run the carry-forward snippet against a captured loop
   output and confirm all three `LOCAL_AI_*` keys are present in the
   environment afterwards.
8. Add the unit cases to the three suites named in **Testing Strategy**.
   **Verify**: run each suite and confirm it exits 0.
9. Run `bash scripts/development-workflow/select-test-suites.sh` against the
   change set and confirm the three suites are selected. **Verify**: read the
   selection output and confirm it names them.
10. Produce the five planted-violation proofs (P1–P5) from **Testing Strategy**
    and record them in the PR description under a `Planted-Violation Proofs`
    heading. **Verify**: each proof shows two runs at a concrete file and line —
    failing with the violation planted, passing once removed.
11. Run `shellcheck` on both changed scripts and `markdownlint-cli2` on both
    changed protocol documents, the plan, and the runbook. **Verify**: both
    tools exit 0.
12. Add a changelog fragment
    `changelog.d/1648.changed.reviewer-loop-current-head-evidence.md` containing
    exactly:

    ```markdown
    - **Reviewer-loop current-head evidence** (#1648): the reviewer-loop summary and history now record which commit each reviewer actually reviewed, and a stale local-ai-reviewer clean result no longer satisfies `ready-for-human-review`.
    ```

13. Update project docs per **Documentation Updates** above (step 7 covers the
    two protocol files; no other project doc is affected).
