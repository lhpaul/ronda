# Strict Spec Contract Review — Spec

**Depends on**: 1653-split-reviewer-prompts-by-stage

---

## Overview

A specification is a contract, and a contract fails in ways prose does not. Its acceptance criteria can disagree with each other, or state something no test could distinguish. A gate described in sentences can leave a combination of its inputs unmentioned. A way to opt out can have its source of truth named twice, or nowhere. A worked example can demonstrate what the rule beside it forbids. None of these read as errors; they read as a document.

The local reviewer sees spec pull requests today and applies the same contract to them as to everything else. This feature gives it a stricter checklist for specs — the questions above, asked one at a time — and has it report what that checklist found as **labelled, non-blocking findings**.

Non-blocking is the point of the first release. Nobody knows yet how often the strict questions fire, or how many of their answers are worth acting on; a checklist that blocks before that is known will be silenced rather than tuned. The findings are labelled so they can be counted, and the decision to make them blocking is deferred to a later item that will have the counts.

## Issue-Objective Traceability

Every objective stated in issue #1650 maps to acceptance criteria and use cases here, or to an explicit entry under **Out of Scope (MVP)** with a deferral note. No objective is dropped.

| # | Objective (from #1650) | Where it is satisfied |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | *Problem* — spec pull requests pass local review while external reviewers find contradictions | Use Cases 1 and 2; AC-1, AC-2, AC-15 |
| 2 | *Outcome* — the local reviewer applies a stricter spec checklist before expensive reviewers run | Use Case 1; AC-1, AC-3, AC-14 |
| 3 | *Scope* — validate acceptance-criterion consistency and testability | Check 1 and Check 2 in Statuses / Enum Values; AC-4, AC-5 |
| 4 | *Scope* — require decision matrices for gate-like behavior | Check 3; AC-6, AC-7 |
| 5 | *Scope* — check opt-out source of truth | Check 4; AC-8 |
| 6 | *Scope* — check trigger semantics | Check 5; AC-9 |
| 7 | *Scope* — check examples against the rules they illustrate | Check 6; AC-10 |
| 8 | *Scope* — check parser and input-surface consistency | Check 7; AC-11 |
| 9 | *Scope* — flag ambiguous phrases that change behavior | Check 8; AC-12, AC-13 |

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: A spec is reviewed strictly

**Actor**: The reviewer loop, running on behalf of the agent or maintainer advancing a pull request.
**Preconditions**: The change is at the spec stage, as the previous item's stage resolution determines.

**Steps**:

1. The loop starts a local review.
2. The reviewer is given the ordinary review contract, the spec checklist, and — new here — the strict spec checks.
3. It applies each check to the specification under review.
4. It reports what it finds: ordinary findings as it does today, and strict-check findings **labelled as such**, each naming the check it came from.
5. The review's overall verdict is decided **without** the strict findings.

**Postconditions**: The pull request carries the strict findings, visibly separated from the blocking ones, and its verdict is what it would have been without them.

**Information shown**:

- Each strict finding, with the check that produced it and where it applies.
- A count of strict findings, so the volume is visible without reading them.

**Considerations**:

- The checks apply **only** at the spec stage. A plan or an implementation change is not a specification, and running spec contract questions against one produces noise that teaches reviewers to ignore the label.
- The strict findings never change the verdict — not to block, and not to unblock. A specification with three strict findings and no blocking ones is clean.

---

### Use Case 2: A maintainer reads the strict findings

**Actor**: A maintainer, or the agent advancing the item.

**Steps**:

1. They open the pull request and see the strict findings grouped and labelled.
2. Each names its check, so the reader can tell an acceptance-criterion contradiction from a missing decision matrix without reading both.
3. They fix what is worth fixing and leave the rest.

**Postconditions**: The specification improves where the reader agreed, and the ignored findings remain recorded.

**Considerations**:

- Ignoring a strict finding must cost nothing: no label, no gate, no reminder. That is what makes the count trustworthy — a reviewer who must justify each dismissal starts dismissing them silently instead.
- The findings stay in the pull request rather than being cleared, so a later reader can see what was raised and not acted on.

---

### Use Case 3: The strict checks find nothing

**Actor**: The local reviewer.

**Steps**:

1. The reviewer applies every check in the list and none matches.
2. It reports a strict-finding count of zero.

**Postconditions**: The count is zero and is reported. A specification that produced no strict findings is distinguishable from one where the checks did not run.

**Considerations**:

- **Silence and zero are different**, and the distinction is the feature's only defence against quietly not working. A run where the checks did not fire — wrong stage, missing checklist, an older reviewer, or an attempt that failed — must not look like a run where they fired and found nothing.

---

### Use Case 4: The strict checks produce no result

**Actor**: The reviewer loop.
**Preconditions**: The checks reach no verdict, for one of three reasons — the stage could not be resolved, the checklist is missing or unreadable, or the checks were attempted and did not complete.

**Steps**:

1. The reviewer runs its ordinary review.
2. It records that the strict checks produced no result, and which of the three causes applies.

**Postconditions**: The review completed and its verdict is unaffected. The record says the strict checks reached no verdict, and says why.

**Considerations**:

- **Two of the causes mean the checks never started; the third means they started and did not finish.** The outcome for the review is identical — no findings, no verdict change, nothing gated — and the outcome for whoever has to fix it is not. A missing checklist is a repository defect; a pass that crashes is a defect in the reviewer command or its environment, and it is the only one of the three that can appear and disappear between two rounds of the same pull request.
- The review is never failed for this, whichever cause applies. The strict checks are an addition to a review, not a precondition for one — and that has to hold for a failure *inside* them as much as for their absence, or an unrelated defect in the reviewer command starts blocking pull requests that had no findings.
- What must not happen is the silent case: a review that reports no strict findings because none ran, or because the run died.

---

### Use Case 5: A later item decides whether to block

**Actor**: A maintainer, reading accumulated counts.

**Steps**:

1. They read, per check, **on how many pull requests it fired at least once** —
   not how many findings it produced in total.
2. They decide whether any check has earned the right to block.

**Postconditions**: A decision informed by incidence data rather than by
expectation.

**Considerations**:

- **The data is incidence, not compliance**, and the difference is deliberate.
  This feature records how often each check fires. It does **not** record which
  findings were acted on, and cannot: it has no per-finding identity and no
  acknowledgement mechanism, both excluded under Out of Scope for the reason
  that tracking dismissals would make ignoring a finding cost something — after
  which the counts measure obedience rather than incidence.
- Counts alone are enough for the decision the item defers. A check that fires
  on nearly every specification is either finding something real and pervasive
  or is miscalibrated, and either way it has not earned the right to block; a
  check that fires rarely is the candidate. Distinguishing those needs
  frequency, which this feature provides.
- **Frequency is counted per pull request.** Summing per-round findings would
  count one unresolved contradiction once per review round — AC-18 requires it
  to be reported again each time — so a check would appear more frequent the
  longer its specification took to merge. The recorded per-round set of check
  identifiers is what makes the per-pull-request measure computable without
  per-finding identity.
- A maintainer who wants to know whether a specific finding was addressed reads
  the pull request. That is a human judgement over a document, and the spec does
  not pretend to automate it.

---

## Business Rules

- The strict checks run **only** at the spec stage.
- Strict findings are **non-blocking**. They never change a review's verdict in either direction.
- Every strict finding names the check that produced it.
- Every review reports the strict-check **state**. The **count** and the set of **check identifiers that produced findings** accompany it only when the state is `applied` — the count including when it is zero — and are empty otherwise, so a round the checks never examined cannot be counted as one they found nothing in.
- Incidence is measured **per pull request**, never by summing rounds: a check fired on a specification if any of its rounds reported that check. Rounds repeat the same findings by design, so a sum would measure how long a pull request stayed open.
- A review where the checks did not run reports that fact and its reason, and is distinguishable from a review where they ran and found nothing.
- A strict finding that a maintainer ignores has no consequence: no pull-request label, no gate, no escalation, no repetition of the demand beyond the ordinary re-reporting of an unresolved finding. This is about **workflow labels** — the kind applied to a pull request to mark its state. Every strict finding still carries its **check identifier**, which is what makes it readable and countable; that identifier is part of the finding, not a mark against the pull request.
- Each check answers a question that can be **wrong**, not one that is a matter of taste. A check whose finding is a preference produces noise, and noise is what makes a label stop being read.
- The checks are a fixed, enumerated set. Adding one is a change to this contract, not a change to a prompt.

## UX Rules

Not applicable — there is no user interface. The reader-facing surfaces are the pull request's review comments and the reviewer's recorded output, both covered under Operational Visibility.

---

## Statuses / Enum Values

### The eight strict checks

Each is stated as the question it asks and the shape of a finding it produces. The identifiers are the labels a finding carries.

| # | Check | The question | A finding looks like |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `ac_consistency` | Do any two acceptance criteria contradict each other, or does one contradict a business rule? | two criteria that cannot both hold |
| 2 | `ac_testability` | Could a test distinguish this criterion being met from its being unmet? | a criterion whose outcome no observation would differ on |
| 3 | `gate_matrix` | Does behavior described as depending on several inputs enumerate every **reachable** combination of them, under the evaluation order the document states? | a described gate with a reachable combination unmentioned, or with an evaluation order it never states |
| 4 | `opt_out_source` | Does each way of disabling or bypassing behavior name exactly one source of truth? | an opt-out named in two places, or in none |
| 5 | `trigger_semantics` | Does each condition that starts behavior say what happens when its inputs are absent, empty or malformed? | a trigger with no stated behavior for a missing input |
| 6 | `example_contradiction` | Does each worked example do what the rule beside it requires? | an example demonstrating what its rule forbids |
| 7 | `parser_surface` | Is each statement about how input is recognised consistent with the syntax the document requires elsewhere, and with the stated tooling? | a matching rule the stated tool cannot express |
| 8 | `ambiguous_phrase` | Does any phrase whose meaning is unsettled — *next update*, *absence of evidence*, *as needed*, *where appropriate* — determine behavior? | an unsettled phrase load-bearing in a rule |

**Check 3 asks for *reachable* combinations, not all of them**, and the distinction is not a softening. A gate whose inputs are evaluated in order — an unresolved stage never compared against a stage name, an absent file never measured — has fewer reachable combinations than the product of its inputs, and enumerating the impossible ones would mean inventing answers for states the system cannot enter. What the check requires instead is that the **order be stated**: unreachability is a claim, and a document that omits combinations without saying why is indistinguishable from one that forgot them.

**Check 8 is bounded to phrases that change behavior.** The same words in a rationale or an aside are not findings. A check that flagged every occurrence would produce a finding on most documents and be switched off within a week — which is the failure mode this whole feature is designed around.

### Strict-check states

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `applied` | The checks ran to completion; the count is what they found, and may be zero |
| `not_applicable` | The change is not at the spec stage |
| `unavailable` | The checks did not produce a result — one of three causes below |

Three states, and `applied` with a count of zero is deliberately not the same as `unavailable`. The **count accompanies `applied` only**: it is empty in the other two states, because a number there would claim the checks reached a verdict they never reached.

`unavailable` has **three causes**, and they are three different things to go and fix:

| Cause | What happened | Whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stage_unresolved` | The change's stage could not be classified, so the checks were never attempted | the pull request's shape |
| `checklist_unreadable` | The stage is `spec` and the checklist is missing or unreadable, so the checks were never attempted | the repository's contents |
| `strict_pass_failed` | The checks were attempted and did not complete — however they failed | the reviewer command or its environment |

The first two mean *never started*; the third means *started and did not finish*. A reader given only `unavailable` cannot tell which, and the three have different owners, which is why the cause is reported wherever the state is.

---

## Decision Matrix

The complete gate, from a review starting to strict findings existing or not. Rows are evaluated in order and the first match decides.

| # | Stage resolves | Stage | Checklist available | Checks complete | Findings | State | Count | Check ids | Verdict affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **No** | — | — | not attempted | — | `unavailable` | **empty** | **empty** | No |
| 2 | Yes | not spec | — | not attempted | — | `not_applicable` | **empty** | **empty** | No |
| 3 | Yes | spec | **No** | not attempted | — | `unavailable` | **empty** | **empty** | No |
| 4 | Yes | spec | Yes | **No** | — | `unavailable` | **empty** | **empty** | No |
| 5 | Yes | spec | Yes | Yes | none | `applied` | `0` | empty list | No |
| 6 | Yes | spec | Yes | Yes | one or more | `applied` | *n* | the checks that fired | **No** |

Six rows over four ordered inputs: can the stage be resolved, is it the spec stage, is the checklist available, did the checks complete. The order matters — an unresolved stage cannot be compared against `spec`, and checks never attempted cannot complete — so row 1 precedes row 2, rows 1 through 3 precede row 4, and no combination evaluates an input the earlier answer made unreachable.

**Row 4 is the one this specification originally omitted**, and the omission is exactly the `gate_matrix` shape check 3 exists to catch: the first draft enumerated the three inputs that decide whether to *start* the checks and never the one that decides whether they *finished*. It was found while planning the implementation, and it is recorded here rather than quietly repaired, because a specification that demands enumerated gates and ships an unenumerated one is the strongest argument the check has.

**The count is empty, not zero, in every row but the last two.** `0` means *the checks ran and found nothing*, and it is the only thing distinguishing a clean specification from one the checks never examined. Writing `0` for `unavailable` or `not_applicable` would put those rounds into the denominator of any later rate as if they had been checked, which is precisely the measurement this feature exists to make possible.

### What each outcome requires, on every surface

The matrix decides the state; this table says what follows from it, so no
surface is left to inference:

| State | Next action | Reviewer output | Review comments | Reviewer-loop history |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unavailable` (rows 1, 3, 4) | none — the review proceeds and its verdict is unchanged | the state and its cause; no count, no identifiers | nothing added | the state and its cause; count and identifiers empty |
| `not_applicable` (row 2) | none | the state; no count, no identifiers | nothing added | the state; count and identifiers empty |
| `applied`, count `0` (row 5) | none | the state and count `0`; identifier list empty | nothing added | the state, count `0`, empty identifier list |
| `applied`, count *n* (row 6) | none that gates — the findings are reported and the verdict is decided without them | the state, the count, and the identifiers that fired | each finding, labelled with its check, grouped apart from blocking findings | the state, the count, and the identifiers that fired |

**"Next action" is empty in every row, and that is the feature.** No state
gates, escalates, retries or demands acknowledgement. The only row with any
follow-up is row 6, whose follow-up is to *report* — which is why the column
exists rather than being omitted: a reader checking whether some state blocks
should find the answer here rather than infer it from silence.

The comment surface is touched in exactly one row. A reader seeing no strict
findings on a pull request cannot tell rows 1 through 5 apart from the comments
alone, which is why the state is on the reviewer output and in the history for
every review.

Row 6's last column is the feature's central claim and the one most likely to erode: findings exist, are labelled, are counted, and change nothing about whether the pull request may proceed.

Rows 1 through 4 differ in what a reader can conclude. Row 2 is a change the checks do not apply to; rows 1, 3 and 4 are changes the checks *should* have examined and could not — the stage was unknown, the checklist was missing, or the checks were attempted and did not finish. All three are defects, with three different owners — the pull request's shape, the repository's contents, the reviewer command or its environment — and collapsing any of them into "no strict findings" makes it invisible.

---

## Operational Visibility

- **Reviewer output**: the strict-check state on every review, its cause in each `unavailable` row, and the finding count when the state is `applied`.
- **Cost**: running the checks costs time on the reviews that run them, taken from inside the review's existing `--timeout` rather than added to it (AC-16b). A round that runs them is typically slower than one that does not; what it is not is *less bounded* — both share the same maximum. And no review is gated, retried or decided differently because the checks ran, failed, or exhausted what was left.
- **Review comments**: each strict finding, labelled with its check identifier, grouped separately from blocking findings.
- **Reviewer-loop history**: per round, the state, the count where it applies, and **which checks produced findings** — the set of check identifiers, not only how many findings there were.

**The unit of measurement is the pull request, not the round.** A round is not an independent observation: the same unresolved finding is reported again on every later round, which AC-18 requires, so summing per-round counts would count one contradiction as many and make a check look more frequent the longer its pull request takes to merge. A check "fired" on a specification when **any** round reports it, and that is what the recorded identifier set makes computable — no per-finding identity needed, and no acknowledgement mechanism.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-1.** At the spec stage, the local reviewer applies every check listed in Statuses / Enum Values — `ac_consistency`, `ac_testability`, `gate_matrix`, `opt_out_source`, `trigger_semantics`, `example_contradiction`, `parser_surface` and `ambiguous_phrase` — naming them rather than counting them, so a check added later cannot be silently omitted by a criterion that still reads as satisfied.
- [ ] **AC-2.** Each strict finding names the check that produced it, using that check's identifier.
- [ ] **AC-3.** Strict findings never change a review's verdict: a review with strict findings and no blocking findings reports the same verdict as the same review with the strict checks disabled.
- [ ] **AC-4.** A specification containing a pair of acceptance criteria that cannot both hold produces an `ac_consistency` finding.
- [ ] **AC-5.** A specification containing an acceptance criterion whose satisfaction no observation could distinguish produces an `ac_testability` finding.
- [ ] **AC-6.** A specification describing behavior that depends on two or more inputs, without enumerating every **reachable** combination of them, produces a `gate_matrix` finding.
- [ ] **AC-6a.** A specification whose gate short-circuits — an earlier input's answer making a later one unevaluated — and which **states that order**, produces **no** `gate_matrix` finding for the combinations the order makes unreachable.
- [ ] **AC-6b.** A specification whose gate short-circuits and does **not** state the order produces a `gate_matrix` finding: the unmentioned combinations are indistinguishable from forgotten ones, and the reader cannot tell which.
- [ ] **AC-7.** A specification that enumerates every reachable combination produces **no** `gate_matrix` finding.
- [ ] **AC-8.** A specification naming a way to disable behavior in two places, or in none, produces an `opt_out_source` finding.
- [ ] **AC-9.** A specification whose trigger condition does not say what happens when an input is absent, empty or malformed produces a `trigger_semantics` finding.
- [ ] **AC-10.** A specification containing a worked example that does what its neighbouring rule forbids produces an `example_contradiction` finding.
- [ ] **AC-11.** A specification whose statement about recognising input is inconsistent with the syntax it requires elsewhere, or with the stated tooling, produces a `parser_surface` finding.
- [ ] **AC-12.** A specification in which an unsettled phrase determines behavior produces an `ambiguous_phrase` finding.
- [ ] **AC-13.** The same phrase appearing in a rationale, an aside, or any passage that determines no behavior produces **no** finding.
- [ ] **AC-14.** The strict checks do not run outside the spec stage, and the state is `not_applicable`.
- [ ] **AC-15.** At the spec stage with the checks applied and nothing found, the state is `applied` and the count is `0` — distinguishable from `unavailable` and from `not_applicable`.
- [ ] **AC-16.** When the checklist cannot be supplied, the state is `unavailable`, the review still runs, and its verdict is unaffected.
- [ ] **AC-16a.** When the checks are attempted and do not complete — however they fail — the state is `unavailable` with a cause distinguishing it from the other two, the review still runs, and its verdict, findings and their order are what the same review produces with the checks never attempted. A failure in the checks never **blocks, gates, retries or escalates** a review, and never alters its outcome.
- [ ] **AC-16b.** The checks **share the review's existing time budget** rather than receiving one of their own: a round that runs them is bounded by the reviewer's `--timeout` in total, the same bound as a round that does not. The checks are attempted with whatever remains of that budget once the review has been produced; if nothing remains they produce no result. Running them takes time a review without them would not spend, and it takes it from inside the bound that already existed.
- [ ] **AC-16c.** The bound has exactly one source and **no second setting exists**: there is no configuration, environment variable or flag that sets the checks' budget separately, capped or otherwise, and none that raises the round's total. Overriding the review's timeout is the only way to change either. A second knob, even a capped one, is one more place for two values to disagree about a bound whose entire purpose is that a round cannot outlast it.
- [ ] **AC-16d.** A budget exhausted before or during the checks is `unavailable` with the same cause as any other failed attempt, and is not distinguished from one: the review is complete, its outcome is unaffected, and *the checks produced no result* is the whole of what a reader needs. Which way an attempt failed is a matter for whoever runs the reviewer, not for the record.
- [ ] **AC-17.** The state appears in the reviewer's output and in the reviewer-loop history for **every** review, at any stage. The count **and** the set of check identifiers that produced findings accompany it only in the `applied` state; in `not_applicable` and `unavailable` both are **empty**, and the count is never `0`.
- [ ] **AC-17b.** A reader can determine, from the history alone, **which** checks produced findings on a round — not only how many findings there were.
- [ ] **AC-17c.** Two rounds reporting the same unresolved finding count that check **once** for the pull request: incidence is per pull request, and repeated rounds do not increase it.
- [ ] **AC-17a.** A round recorded as `unavailable` or `not_applicable` is distinguishable from one recorded as `applied` with count `0`, by reading the history alone.
- [ ] **AC-18.** Ignoring a strict finding has no effect on any later review: no **pull-request label**, no gate, no escalation, and the same finding may be reported again on a later round without penalty. The finding's own check identifier, required by AC-2, is unaffected — it identifies the finding and marks nothing about the pull request.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

1. **Making any check blocking.** Deferred until counts exist. This feature produces the data; the decision needs it, and needs to be taken per check rather than for all eight at once — the checks will not earn it at the same rate.
2. **A report over strict-finding counts.** #1657 owns reporting. This feature records the state and count per round so that report is possible.
2a. **Any measure of whether a finding was acted on.** The recorded data is incidence — how often each check fires — and never disposition. Measuring dismissals would require per-finding identity and an acknowledgement step, and would make ignoring a finding cost something, which Business Rules forbid. Use Case 5's decision is taken on frequency alone, and the spec says so rather than implying a richer dataset it does not produce.
3. **Strict checks for plans and implementations.** The same idea applies to a plan, and its questions are different ones. Extending it is a separate item, and doing it here would mean writing three checklists to validate one.
4. **Suppression, acknowledgement or per-finding dismissal.** Ignoring a finding must cost nothing, which is exactly why there is no mechanism for recording that you ignored it. Adding one would make the counts measure compliance rather than incidence. "Costs nothing" refers to pull-request state — no workflow label, no gate, no escalation — and not to the finding's own check identifier, which every finding carries.
5. **Automatically fixing what the checks find.** Every one of the eight names a contradiction, and choosing which side is correct is a product decision.
6. **Tuning the checks by measured yield.** The checks ship as written. Retiring or rewording one belongs to the same later item that decides on blocking, with the same data behind it.
