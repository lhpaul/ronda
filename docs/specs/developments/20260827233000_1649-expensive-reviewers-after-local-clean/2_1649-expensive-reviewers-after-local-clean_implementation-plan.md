## Summary

**Approach**: The reviewer loop already has a phase mechanism —
`phase_after_clean_platforms` (alias `ready_phase_platforms`) — that holds a
platform back until the loop reaches it, and the loop breaks out before that
point when an earlier platform returns non-clean. What the phase gate does *not*
check is whether the accumulated evidence is (a) about the current head and
(b) complete: it evaluates only earlier reviewer verdicts from this same run,
never review threads, never baseline CI, and it has no notion of a stale local
clean result. This plan adds a dedicated pre-dispatch gate for `codex-github`
that requires four current-head conditions — the local reviewer clean and
current; every reviewer that **precedes** it having produced acceptable evidence
(a `clean` result, or a `skipped` one whose reason is a member of a fixed
allow-list of deliberate policy skips — deliberately **not** every `skipped`,
and deliberately not "any reason that is not a known failure", which would
accept unknown and future reasons); zero unresolved non-outdated review threads;
and a non-empty set of non-reviewer baseline checks, all green — evaluated
immediately before the platform is dispatched, fail-closed when any input is
missing or stale, with one explicit documented override for manual escalation.
A gate that holds the reviewer back **defers** rather than skipping: it sets the
loop's aggregate to `needs_fixes` so readiness is withheld and Step 7 re-runs,
which is what makes the deferral guaranteed rather than merely hoped for.

**Estimated complexity**: L

**Rationale**: The gate itself is a bounded addition, but it sits on the loop's
hottest control path, must compose with three existing mechanisms that already
decide whether a platform runs (`phase_after_clean`, `--pre-after-clean-only`,
and the cycle caps), and it consumes evidence that sibling item #1648
introduces. Getting the composition wrong either makes the gate inert or
silently stops `codex-github` from ever running, and both failures are invisible
in a green check rollup.

**Dependencies**: **#1648 must be merged to
`develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` before this item's implementation
PR opens.** This plan consumes `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` and
`LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`, which #1648 introduces, and the fail-closed semantics
this gate applies to a missing `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` are the ones #1648 defines.
The plan PRs are independent and may be reviewed in parallel; only the
implementation is ordered.

## Verification Log

| Check | Command / query | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo revision | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` | `7998d43d` (base `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness`) |
| Phase mechanism exists | `grep -n "phase_after_clean_platforms\|append_ready_phase_platforms" scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `append_ready_phase_platforms` delegates to `append_phase_after_clean_platforms`; `is_phase_after_clean_platform` decides membership; the ready-phase list is emitted as `READY_PHASE_PLATFORM_LIST` |
| Phase gate contents | `sed -n '8576,8616p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Before the first phase platform runs, the loop calls `ensure_pr_ready_for_ready_phase` and nothing else; that function only reads `isDraft` and runs `gh pr ready` |
| Gate checks no evidence | `sed -n '6211,6256p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `ensure_pr_ready_for_ready_phase` inspects draft state and the rate limit only — no head SHA, no review threads, no CI, no reviewer verdicts |
| Non-clean short-circuit is per-run | Observed on PR #1660: a cycle where `local-ai-reviewer` returned `needs_fixes` emitted `READY_PHASE_SKIP_REASON=needs_fixes` and `PHASE_AFTER_CLEAN_STARTED=0`; a later clean cycle emitted `PHASE_AFTER_CLEAN_STARTED=1` | The existing hold-back works, but it is decided entirely by verdicts collected within the same invocation |
| `codex-github` dispatch path | `grep -n "codex-github" scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Dispatched via `run_codex_github_review` at the `codex-github)` case of `run_platform_review`; `codex_github_defaults_should_apply` already tests membership with `array_contains_value` |
| `codex-github` is not configured here | `sed -n '/^review:/,/^ *guardrails:/p' .ai-dev-workflow.yaml` | This repository's `on_draft.github` is `local-ai-reviewer, pr-agent` and `on_ready.github` is `bugbot`; `codex-github` appears in neither, so the gate must be inert-by-absence here and exercised through harness fixtures |
| Evidence keys come from #1648 | `gh pr view 1660 --json state --jq .state` and the plan on that PR | `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` / `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` are defined by #1648, whose plan PR #1660 is `ready-for-human-review` and not yet merged |
| Baseline vs reviewer checks | `sed -n '112,147p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh` | The classification lives in one function, `configured_reviewer_check_names_json`, which maps configured review platforms to their GitHub check names (`haystack` → `Haystack / Review`, `bugbot` → `Cursor Bugbot`). Everything downstream — `REVIEWER_CHECK_COUNT`, `REVIEWER_CHECKS`, `REVIEWER_CHECKS_JSON` — is `jq` over that one list, so relocating the function is enough to share it |
| Both scripts already share a library | `grep -n "source .*workflow-lib" scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Both source `workflow-lib.sh` at line 7 and line 10 respectively, so the function can move there with no new dependency and no change to either script's load order |
| `codex-github` integration doc exists | `ls docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/` | `codex-github.md` is present alongside `local-ai-reviewer.md`, `pr-agent.md`, and `bugbot.md`, so the gate's documentation target already exists and no new file is created |
| Reviewer-loop protocol target | `grep -c "" docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md` | 1142 lines; this is the protocol that documents loop behavior, and is the right home for the gate's normative description |
| Cycle caps exist | `grep -n "MAX_CYCLES\|MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES" scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Dual caps are present: `max_cycles` per run and `max_total_cycles` per PR lifetime |
| Cycle caps cannot bound deferrals | `sed -n '7371,7390p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count` reduces qualifying entries with `unique` over `(.head_sha) + "\|" + (.result)` before counting, on both the lifetime and per-run axes. Repeated `needs_fixes` results on one unchanged head — the exact shape of a deferral loop — therefore collapse to a single count and advance neither cap. This is why the gate needs its own occurrence-counted, head-scoped deferral counter rather than reusing these |

## Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check

### Applicable

| Assumption surface | Recorded value | Authoritative source | Verified at | Bounded cross-check scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approved base branch for this item | `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` | `integration-branch:internal-reviewer-effectiveness` label on #1649; Protocol 91 § Integration-branch base override | 2026-08-27, repo SHA `7998d43d` | Epic #1647 items #1648–#1657; the only other open PR on this base is #1660 (#1648's plan) | `Verified` |
| Source of the current-head local evidence | `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` / `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` from #1648 | #1648's implementation plan on PR #1660 | 2026-08-27, repo SHA `7998d43d` | #1648 and #1649 only | `Conflict` — see below |

**Conflict record.** The evidence keys this gate consumes do not exist on the
base branch yet: #1648's plan PR #1660 is `ready-for-human-review` and unmerged,
so no implementation has landed. Affected plan statements: every reference to
`LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` and `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`, and the fail-closed rule for
a missing local evidence key.

**Resolution status**: `Resolved` by sequencing, not by weakening the plan. This
is a plan-stage artifact; the ordering requirement is recorded in
**Dependencies** and enforced in **Implementation Order** step 0, which stops
before any code change if #1648 is not merged into
`develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness`. Decision owner: LH — if #1648 is
rejected or materially changed in human review, this plan must be revised before
implementation rather than adapted during it.

## Layer-by-Layer Changes

### Backend / API

Not applicable — this repository ships workflow tooling, not a service.

### Shared Packages / Libraries

`scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` (shell contract: `bash`):

- [ ] Add `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWER_PLATFORMS`, a constant list whose only member is
      `codex-github`. The gate keys off this list rather than hard-coding the
      platform name at the call site, so a later item can add a second expensive
      reviewer without touching the gate logic. It is intentionally not
      configurable from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`: which reviewers are expensive is
      a property of the reviewer, not of the repository.
- [ ] Add `is_expensive_reviewer_platform <platform>` using the existing
      `array_contains_value` helper, mirroring `is_phase_after_clean_platform`.
- [ ] Add `expensive_reviewer_gate <pr_number> <platform> <head_sha>` returning
      `0` to dispatch and `1` to defer, and printing one `EXPENSIVE_GATE_*`
      key=value block. It evaluates the conditions below against
      `loop_head_sha` (the pre-dispatch snapshot #1648 makes authoritative) and
      **stops at the first unmet one**, so the reported reason names a single
      cause.

      | # | Condition | Unmet reason |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | 1 | `expensive_gate_local_ai_configured` returns exactly `1` **and** `expensive_gate_local_ai_head_current` returns exactly `1` | `local_reviewer_not_configured` when the first returns `0`; `local_evidence_stale` when the second returns `0`; `local_evidence_missing` when either returns an empty string or any value other than `0` or `1` |
      | 2 | Every platform in this reviewer's **peer set** (defined below) has already run in this invocation **and** produced acceptable peer evidence | `peer_reviewer_not_run` when one has not run yet; `peer_reviewer_not_clean` when one ran without producing acceptable evidence |
      | 3 | Zero unresolved, non-outdated review threads | `unresolved_threads` |
      | 4 | The non-reviewer check set on `loop_head_sha` is **non-empty** and every member is `SUCCESS`, `SKIPPED`, or `NEUTRAL` | `baseline_checks_not_green` when one failed; `baseline_checks_pending` when one is still running; `baseline_checks_unobserved` when the set is empty |

- [ ] **Reorder expensive reviewers last *within their own phase bucket*.** Add
      `reorder_expensive_reviewers_last`, called once after the platform list is
      resolved and before the iteration begins. Detection alone is not enough —
      a configuration listing `codex-github` before `pr-agent` would otherwise
      defer at the same point on every invocation, because the loop would never
      reach `pr-agent` before the gate, and the deferral would never resolve.
      Reordering makes the gate's precondition reachable rather than merely
      checked.
- [ ] **The reorder must not cross the draft/ready boundary.** A single global
      partition would move every expensive reviewer behind every non-expensive
      one, including behind the ready-phase platforms: `codex-github` configured
      in `review.on_draft.github` alongside `bugbot` in `review.on_ready.github`
      would end up running only after `bugbot` triggered the ready-phase
      transition, silently inverting the configuration contract that draft
      reviewers run before `gh pr ready`. The function therefore partitions
      **within each bucket independently** — the non-phase platforms among
      themselves, the `phase_after_clean_platforms` among themselves — using
      the existing `is_phase_after_clean_platform` predicate to assign buckets,
      and concatenates the buckets in their original order. Relative order is
      preserved within each partition. An expensive reviewer therefore runs last
      among its own phase peers and never changes phase.
- [ ] Emit `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS_REORDERED=1` and the reordered `PLATFORM_LIST`
      when the partition changed the order, so the behavior is visible rather
      than a silent rewrite of the caller's configuration.
- [ ] **Share the reviewer/baseline check classification by relocating one
      function — do not call `pr-ci-loop.sh`.** Condition 4 needs to know which
      checks are reviewer-owned so a reviewer's own check cannot gate that
      reviewer. That classification exists today as
      `configured_reviewer_check_names_json` in
      `scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh` (lines 112–147); everything
      downstream of it — `REVIEWER_CHECK_COUNT`, `REVIEWER_CHECKS`,
      `REVIEWER_CHECKS_JSON` — is `jq` over the list it returns. The concrete
      change:
      1. Move `configured_reviewer_check_names_json` **verbatim** from
         `pr-ci-loop.sh` into `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`,
         and delete the local definition. Both scripts already source
         `workflow-lib.sh` (`pr-ci-loop.sh` line 7, `pr-review-loop.sh`
         line 10), so no new dependency and no load-order change is introduced.
         This is a pure relocation of already-proven logic with no behavior
         change; state that exemption rationale in the PR per
         `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md`.
      2. Add `expensive_gate_baseline_checks_status <pr_number> <head_sha>` in
         `pr-review-loop.sh`. It fetches the check rollup **once** via
         `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup,headRefOid`, excludes any check
         whose name appears in `configured_reviewer_check_names_json`, and
         prints one of `green`, `failed`, `pending`, `empty`, or `unavailable`
         plus the live head it observed.
      2b. **An empty check set is not green.** "Every member is green" is
         vacuously true of an empty set, so a snapshot taken before CI jobs
         register on the new head would dispatch the expensive reviewer with no
         baseline evidence at all — the fail-closed contract inverted by a
         quantifier. `expensive_gate_baseline_checks_status` therefore returns
         a distinct `empty` state, and the gate defers with
         `baseline_checks_unobserved`.

         The gate deliberately does **not** try to distinguish "this repository
         legitimately runs no baseline checks" from "the checks have not
         registered yet": a single rollup snapshot cannot tell them apart, and
         guessing would reintroduce the vacuous-green hole. Both defer. A
         repository with genuinely no baseline CI reaches a human through the
         deferral cap after `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS` rounds,
         with `baseline_checks_unobserved` naming the cause — which is the right
         outcome, because "run an expensive reviewer with no CI at all" is a
         decision worth a human, not a default. `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_FORCE_EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS`
         covers the one-off case.
      3. **Do not invoke `pr-ci-loop.sh` from the gate.** That script is a
         polling loop with its own waits and its own exit semantics; calling it
         here would block the reviewer loop inside a gate that must be a
         non-blocking snapshot, and would conflate "CI is not green yet" with
         "the gate says wait". The gate takes a snapshot; the CI loop remains
         Step 8's job.
- [ ] **Define acceptable peer evidence with a positive allow-list.** Accepting
      any `skipped` peer would let `codex-github` dispatch when a configured
      peer was unavailable, timed out, or was rejected for credentials — the
      "no cheap pre-filter actually ran" state this item exists to prevent. But
      deciding acceptance by asking whether
      `reviewer_failed_label_required_for_result` returns false is the same
      deny-list mistake in another place: that helper enumerates a *known* set
      of failure reasons and returns false for anything it does not recognise,
      including the empty string and any reason a future reviewer integration
      introduces. A new skip reason would silently become acceptable evidence.
      Acceptance is therefore an explicit allow-list:

      ```text
      EXPENSIVE_GATE_ACCEPTED_SKIP_REASONS=(not_configured explicit-skip release_pr unsupported-platform)
      ```

      A peer's evidence is acceptable when its result is `clean`, or when its
      result is `skipped` **and** its reason is a member of that list **and**
      `reviewer_failed_label_required_for_result` returns false for the pair.
      The membership test is what makes it fail-closed; the helper call is a
      second gate so a reason cannot be accepted here while the loop elsewhere
      treats it as a reviewer failure. Every other result — `needs_fixes`,
      `needs_rerun`, `escalate`, and every unlisted, unknown or empty skip
      reason — defers with `peer_reviewer_not_clean`.

      Each member is on the list for a stated reason: `not_configured` and
      `unsupported-platform` mean the reviewer was never going to run in this
      repository; `explicit-skip` is an operator's deliberate choice;
      `release_pr` is the release-guard path, where review already happened on
      the feature PRs. Adding a member is a deliberate act with a rationale, not
      a side effect of a reviewer integration landing elsewhere.

- [ ] **Define the peer set as the platforms that precede this reviewer under
      the reordered list.** It cannot be the whole resolved list: the reorder
      preserves phase buckets, so a draft-phase `codex-github` necessarily runs
      before a ready-phase `bugbot`, and requiring every non-expensive platform
      to have run would make that documented configuration defer with
      `peer_reviewer_not_run` on every invocation until the cap — deadlocking
      exactly the configuration scenario 6b exists to support. The peer set is
      therefore:

      - every non-expensive platform in the **same** phase bucket as this
        expensive reviewer, plus
      - **every** platform in any earlier bucket (a ready-phase expensive
        reviewer waits on the whole draft bucket, expensive members included,
        because those have already run by then).

      A draft-phase `codex-github` therefore waits on the non-expensive draft
      platforms only, and does not wait on `bugbot`. This set is well-defined
      only *because* of the reorder: after it, "precedes this reviewer" and
      "should have produced evidence before this reviewer" are the same set.
      The set is computed from the reordered list and this reviewer's index in
      it, not from the results collected so far, so `peer_reviewer_not_run`
      remains a defensive assertion rather than an expected outcome: if it
      fires, the reorder did not happen and the gate says so instead of silently
      dispatching.
- [ ] **Bind conditions 3 and 4 to the same head as the reviewer evidence.**
      Both queries must return the live head alongside their payload, and the
      gate must compare it to `loop_head_sha`. If they differ, the PR moved
      while the loop ran: the thread and check evidence describes a newer commit
      than the reviewer verdicts, and combining them would authorize dispatch on
      inconsistent evidence. Defer with `evidence_head_moved`. This mirrors the
      head-move guard the loop already applies to its own clean verdict, and
      reuses the same `loop_head_sha` snapshot rather than introducing a second
      notion of "current".
- [ ] **A defer is not a clean skip.** Recording a deferred expensive reviewer
      as `skipped` while leaving the aggregate result unchanged would let
      Protocol 92's readiness conditions accept the run — `Result: clean` or
      `Result: skipped` both satisfy them — so a PR could reach
      `ready-for-human-review` having never run the reviewer, and nothing would
      guarantee the "next invocation" this gate relies on. Instead, when the
      gate defers, the loop sets its aggregate to `needs_fixes` with
      `REASON=expensive_gate_deferred`. That is the loop's existing mechanism
      for "not finished yet": Protocol 91 re-runs Step 7 on a non-clean result,
      the readiness label is withheld, and the deferral is therefore guaranteed
      to be retried rather than merely hoped for.
- [ ] **Bound the deferrals with their own counter — the existing caps do not
      cover them.** `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count` buckets qualifying
      entries as `unique` over `head_sha + "|" + result`, so repeated
      `needs_fixes` results on one unchanged head collapse to a single count on
      both the per-run and lifetime axes. Deferrals are exactly that shape: the
      head does not move while the gate waits, so an unbounded number of
      deferral cycles would advance neither cap. Add a dedicated counter that
      reads the ledger for entries whose `expensive_gate.result` is `deferred`
      **and** whose `expensive_gate.head` equals the current `loop_head_sha`,
      counted as occurrences rather than uniques, bounded by
      `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS` (default `3`). On reaching the
      cap the loop stops deferring and escalates with `RESULT=escalate` and
      `REASON=expensive_gate_deferral_cap`, naming the condition that kept
      failing, so a stuck gate reaches a human instead of cycling silently. The
      counter resets naturally when the head moves, because it is scoped to
      `loop_head_sha`.
- [ ] **Validate `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS` before using it.**
      An unvalidated value is passed straight into `[ "$deferrals" -ge "$max" ]`,
      where a non-integer raises `integer expression expected` and the
      comparison silently evaluates false — defeating the cap entirely — and
      where `0` or a negative number would trip the cap before the first
      deferral, escalating every gated PR immediately. Resolve it with
      `expensive_gate_resolve_max_deferrals`, following the convention
      `reviewer_loop_resolve_max_cycles` already establishes in this script:

      | Configured value | Effective value |
      | --- | --- |
      | Unset or empty | `3` (the default) |
      | A positive integer within `1`–`999999` | that value |
      | `0`, a negative number, a non-integer, or a value above `999999` | `3`, with a `WARN` on stderr naming the rejected value |

      The upper bound and the `WARN`-and-fall-back behavior are copied from
      `reviewer_loop_resolve_max_cycles` deliberately: two bounds resolvers in
      one script that disagree about what a bad value means is its own defect.
      Resolve once per run, not per gate call, and emit the effective value as
      `EXPENSIVE_GATE_MAX_DEFERRALS` on every gate call so the bound in force is
      visible alongside `EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS`. Resolve into a run-scoped
      `expensive_gate_max_deferrals` variable before the platform iteration and
      read that variable in the gate; resolving inside the gate would re-emit
      the `WARN` once per expensive platform and re-parse a value that cannot
      change within a run.
- [ ] **The deferral counter is fail-closed only on a genuinely unreadable
      ledger — an absent one is the normal first run.** The counter mirrors the
      three states `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count` already distinguishes,
      and must not collapse them:

      | Ledger state | Counter | Gate behavior |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | No summary comment, or a body with no history marker at all | `0` | normal — this is every PR's first reviewer-loop run, and escalating here would bypass the bounded deferrals on every PR without prior history |
      | Marker present and parseable | the occurrence count for this head | normal |
      | Marker present but no parseable JSON block, schema mismatch, or a persisted `history_status` other than `available` | `-1` | escalate with `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=deferral_cap` and `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION=expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable` |

      Escalating on a genuinely unreadable budget is the conservative choice: a
      human sees the gate immediately, whereas deferring on an unknown budget is
      precisely the unbounded loop this counter exists to prevent. Treating an
      *absent* ledger the same way would invert that, escalating the common case
      and never exercising the bound. `EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS=-1` keeps the
      unreadable state distinguishable from a count of zero.
- [ ] **A repository with no local reviewer defers, it does not dispatch.**
      When `expensive_gate_local_ai_configured` returns `0` there is no
      current-head local clean evidence, and the brief requires `codex-github` to run *only after* that
      evidence exists and to fail closed when it is missing — it permits an
      explicit manual override, not an implicit automatic one. The gate
      therefore defers with `local_reviewer_not_configured`. The consequence for
      a consumer that deliberately does not configure `local-ai-reviewer` is
      handled by the deferral cap below, which escalates to a human after a
      bounded number of deferrals rather than blocking forever, and by
      `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_FORCE_EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS` for a one-off run. Both are
      explicit; neither silently relaxes the gate.
- [ ] **Read the local evidence from in-loop state, not from the environment.**
      #1648 defines `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` and `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` as
      *top-level stdout keys*, printed once for the run. They are not shell
      variables set before the platform iteration, so a gate that reads
      `${LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED:-}` mid-loop would always see them unset and defer
      on every invocation — the gate would be inert in the worst way, always
      refusing. Both values must be derived at gate time from the same in-loop
      state #1648 already maintains:

      | Gate input | In-loop source |
      | --- | --- |
      | `local_ai_configured` | whether `local-ai-reviewer` appears in the resolved `platforms[@]` list — the same membership test `is_expensive_reviewer_platform` uses, applied to the local reviewer |
      | `local_ai_head_current` | `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify` (from #1648) applied to the `local-ai-reviewer` entry of `platform_reviewed_heads` against `loop_head_sha`; `current` maps to `1`, `not-current` to `0`, and a missing entry to the empty string |

      The stdout keys stay exactly as #1648 defines them — they are the
      *serialization* of this same in-loop state at the end of the run, not a
      second source of truth. One producer, two consumers: the gate reads the
      variables, the run prints them, and they cannot disagree.
- [ ] **Condition 1 is an allow-list, not a deny-list.** Both keys are matched
      against their exact expected value: the condition passes only when
      `expensive_gate_local_ai_configured` returns the literal `1` and
      `expensive_gate_local_ai_head_current` returns the literal `1`. Testing only for `0` and empty would let any unexpected
      value — a `2` from a future contract change, a stray `true`, a value with
      trailing whitespace — fall through and authorize the expensive reviewer
      with no valid local-clean evidence, which is the opposite of fail-closed.
      Any value that is neither `0` nor `1` is reported as
      `local_evidence_missing`: it carries no more information than absent
      evidence, and treating it as its own reason would imply the gate
      understood it. The same exact-match discipline applies to every token the
      gate reads.
- [ ] **Fail closed on every unknown.** If any input cannot be read, the gate
      defers with one of exactly three reasons — there is no generic unknown
      state:

      | Unreadable input | Reason |
      | --- | --- |
      | `loop_head_sha` is empty (the pre-dispatch head read failed) | `evidence_unavailable_head` |
      | The review-threads query failed | `evidence_unavailable_review_threads` |
      | The check-rollup query failed | `evidence_unavailable_checks` |

      Deferring is cheap — the expensive reviewer runs on the retry the
      `needs_fixes` aggregate forces — while dispatching on unknown evidence is
      the waste this item exists to remove.
- [ ] **A defer must short-circuit the iteration, not merely set the
      aggregate.** Setting `needs_fixes` without breaking out would leave the
      per-platform loop running, so a later ready-phase platform would still
      reach `ensure_pr_ready_for_ready_phase` and call `gh pr ready` — converting
      the PR out of draft even though a draft-phase expensive reviewer never
      ran. That is a visible, hard-to-undo side effect produced by a gate whose
      whole purpose was to *not* proceed. A `deferred` or `deferral_cap` outcome
      therefore breaks out of the platform iteration immediately, exactly as the
      existing non-clean short-circuit does, before any later platform is
      considered. `forced` and `dispatched` continue normally.
- [ ] Call the gate from the per-platform block, immediately before
      `run_platform_review`, only when `is_expensive_reviewer_platform` matches.
      It composes with the existing phase mechanism rather than replacing it: a
      platform that is both a phase platform and an expensive reviewer must pass
      `ensure_pr_ready_for_ready_phase` **and** this gate, in that order, and
      `--pre-after-clean-only` still excludes phase platforms before either runs.
- [ ] **Explicit override**: `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_FORCE_EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS=1`
      bypasses the gate for manual escalation. When set, the gate still
      evaluates and still emits its full `EXPENSIVE_GATE_*` block, then reports
      `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=forced` with the reason it would otherwise have
      given, and dispatches. The override never hides why the gate would have
      deferred — a forced run that later wastes reviewer cycles must be
      traceable to the condition that was overridden. A forced run does not set
      the `needs_fixes` aggregate: the human took the decision explicitly.
- [ ] Emit gate telemetry on the loop's stdout contract, per expensive
      platform:

      | Key | Values | Emitted |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_PLATFORM` | the platform name | always |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT` | `dispatched` \| `deferred` \| `forced` \| `deferral_cap` | always |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_REASON` | the unmet-condition reason; empty when `dispatched` | always |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_HEAD` | the `loop_head_sha` the gate evaluated | always |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS` | deferrals the ledger records for this head, so the distance to the cap is visible before it trips; `-1` when the ledger could not be read, matching the existing `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count` convention | always |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_MAX_DEFERRALS` | the effective bound after validation, so a rejected or defaulted configuration is visible next to the count it bounds | always |
      | `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` | `expensive_gate_deferral_cap` \| `expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable` | **only** when `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT` is `deferral_cap`; absent otherwise, so its presence is itself the escalation signal and the two causes never have to be re-derived from the count |

      `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS_REORDERED` is emitted once per run, not per platform.
      All values stay inside the `[A-Za-z0-9:_-]` token charset the Protocol 91
      carry-forward snippet admits.
- [ ] Record the gate outcome in the reviewer-loop summary comment as an
      `**Expensive reviewer gate:**` line, and in the `reviewer_loop_history.v1`
      entry as an `expensive_gate` object (`platform`, `result`, `reason`,
      `head`). Both are additive; readers dereference with
      defaults, so the schema stays `v1`, consistent with #1648's treatment of
      `reviewed_heads`.
- [ ] Document the gate in the `--help` usage block: its conditions and their
      evaluation order, its fail-closed rule, the `deferred` aggregate
      behavior, the bounded deferral counter with both of its escalation values
      (`expensive_gate_deferral_cap` and
      `expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable`) and the fact that
      `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` appears only on a `deferral_cap` result, the
      reordering of expensive reviewers last **within their own phase bucket**
      (never across the draft/ready boundary), and the override variable.

### Frontend / UI

Not applicable — no user interface in this repository.

### Infrastructure / Configuration

- [ ] No `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` schema change. `codex-github` is already a
      valid value in `review.on_draft.github` / `review.on_ready.github`; the
      gate applies wherever it is configured. In this repository it is
      configured nowhere, so the gate is inert here by absence — which is why
      every scenario below is a harness fixture rather than a live run.

### Documentation

Both documents below must state the **same** contract, and both must include
the full two-value `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` behavior — smoke test Step 10
reads them against each other and fails on any divergence.

- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`
      — document the gate: the conditions and their evaluation order, the
      order-independence of condition 2 and how its peer set is scoped by phase
      bucket, the head binding of conditions 3 and 4,
      the fail-closed rule, the fact that a `deferred` outcome sets the
      aggregate to `needs_fixes` (so readiness is withheld and Step 7 re-runs)
      rather than passing as a clean skip, the reordering of expensive reviewers
      last **within their own phase bucket** — never across the draft/ready
      boundary — the override variable with the
      expectation that its use is justified in the PR, and the bounded deferral
      counter with **both** escalation causes —
      `expensive_gate_deferral_cap` when the budget is exhausted and
      `expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable` when it cannot be read —
      naming `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` as the key that carries them and
      stating that it is emitted only on a `deferral_cap` result.
- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/codex-github.md` — add a
      section describing the gate so a reader configuring the reviewer learns
      when it will actually run, when it will be deferred, and how to override.
      It must carry the same `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` contract as Protocol 93
      — both values, and the `deferral_cap`-only emission — because a reader who
      only ever opens the integration page must be able to tell an exhausted
      budget from an unreadable one without consulting the protocol. The file
      exists (confirmed in the Verification Log); no new file is created.

## Testing Strategy

**Test types**: Unit (shell harness), plus the smoke test runbook.

**Key scenarios to test**:

1. `is_expensive_reviewer_platform` matches `codex-github` and rejects
   `local-ai-reviewer`, `pr-agent`, and `bugbot` — the gate must not
   accidentally hold back a cheap reviewer.
2. All conditions met → `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=dispatched`,
   `EXPENSIVE_GATE_REASON` empty, and `run_platform_review` is called.
3. The `local-ai-reviewer` entry of `platform_reviewed_heads` records a head
   that is not `loop_head_sha`, so the derivation yields `0` → `deferred` /
   `local_evidence_stale`,
   `run_platform_review` is **not** called, and the loop's aggregate becomes
   `needs_fixes` / `expensive_gate_deferred` — the core of brief scope bullet 1,
   and the proof that a defer withholds readiness instead of passing as a skip.
4. Unexpected and absent derived values are equally refused, one case per row —
   the allow-list check for brief scope bullet 2, pairing with #1648's rule that
   absent evidence is telemetry loss rather than non-applicability. Each row
   stubs the return of `expensive_gate_local_ai_configured` and
   `expensive_gate_local_ai_head_current`; nothing is exported:

   | `configured` | `head_current` | Required result |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | empty | `1` | `deferred` / `local_evidence_missing` |
   | `2` | `1` | `deferred` / `local_evidence_missing` |
   | `true` | `1` | `deferred` / `local_evidence_missing` |
   | `1` | empty | `deferred` / `local_evidence_missing` |
   | `1` | `2` | `deferred` / `local_evidence_missing` |
   | `1` | `yes` | `deferred` / `local_evidence_missing` |

   The `2`, `true` and `yes` rows are the ones a deny-list implementation fails:
   they are neither `0` nor empty, so testing only for those would let them
   through and dispatch the expensive reviewer with no valid evidence.
5. `local-ai-reviewer` is absent from the resolved platform list, so the
   derivation yields `0` → `deferred` / `local_reviewer_not_configured`.
   Distinct from scenario 4 (`missing` means the telemetry never arrived; this
   means the platform is genuinely not configured), and deliberately still a
   defer: the brief requires the expensive reviewer to run only after
   current-head local clean evidence and to fail closed when it is absent. The
   consumer that never configures a local reviewer is released by the deferral
   cap in scenario 13 or by the override in scenario 15, both explicit.
6. `reorder_expensive_reviewers_last` moves `codex-github` to the end of a
   platform list that declared it first, preserves the relative order of the
   remaining platforms, emits `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS_REORDERED=1`, and leaves an
   already-correct list untouched with the flag unset. This is what makes the
   gate's precondition reachable: without it the loop would defer at the same
   point on every invocation and the deferral would never resolve.
6b. The reorder respects phase buckets: with `codex-github` in
    `review.on_draft.github` and `bugbot` in `review.on_ready.github`,
    `codex-github` ends last **among the draft platforms** and still precedes
    `bugbot`. A global partition would place it after `bugbot` and therefore
    after the ready-phase transition, inverting the configuration contract that
    draft reviewers run before `gh pr ready`.
7. The peer set is scoped by phase, not the whole list:

   Every row also configures `local-ai-reviewer` on draft with a current-head
   `platform_reviewed_heads` entry, so condition 1 is satisfied and the row
   isolates condition 2. Without that, a row expecting `dispatched` would be
   internally impossible — condition 1 is evaluated first and would defer with
   `local_reviewer_not_configured`.

   | Configuration | Peer set for `codex-github` | Outcome with all peers clean |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `codex-github`, `pr-agent` and `local-ai-reviewer` all draft; `bugbot` ready | `pr-agent` and `local-ai-reviewer` — **not** `bugbot` | `dispatched` |
   | `codex-github` ready; `pr-agent` and `local-ai-reviewer` draft | the whole draft bucket | `dispatched` |
   | Reorder suppressed so a same-bucket peer has not run | that peer | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_run` |

   The first row is the one a whole-list peer set fails: a draft-phase
   `codex-github` necessarily runs before a ready-phase `bugbot`, so requiring
   `bugbot` would defer on every invocation until the cap, deadlocking the
   configuration scenario 6b exists to support. Scenario 8 covers what happens
   once a peer *has* run.
8. Peer evidence acceptance, one case per class — distinct from scenario 7's
   `peer_reviewer_not_run`, which is about a peer that has not run at all:

   | Peer result and reason | Gate outcome |
   | --- | --- |
   | `clean` | contributes to `dispatched` |
   | `skipped` / `not_configured` | contributes to `dispatched` |
   | `skipped` / `explicit-skip` | contributes to `dispatched` |
   | `skipped` / `unavailable` | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |
   | `skipped` / `timeout` | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |
   | `skipped` / `unauthorized` | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |
   | `needs_fixes` | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |
   | `escalate` | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |

   | `skipped` / `release_pr` | contributes to `dispatched` |
   | `skipped` / `unsupported-platform` | contributes to `dispatched` |
   | `skipped` / `some_future_reason` (unknown) | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |
   | `skipped` / `""` (empty reason) | `deferred` / `peer_reviewer_not_clean` |

   The four accepted rows are the members of
   `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ACCEPTED_SKIP_REASONS`; the unknown and empty rows are the
   fail-closed cases that a helper-only rule would have accepted, since
   `reviewer_failed_label_required_for_result` returns false for any reason it
   does not recognise. Both the membership test and the helper call must be
   asserted, in that order.
9. One unresolved non-outdated review thread → `deferred` /
   `unresolved_threads`; the same thread marked outdated → `dispatched`.
10. Baseline-check states, one case each. Every row that expects `dispatched`
    must include **at least one green non-reviewer check**, or filtering leaves
    the set empty and the row hits the empty-set rule instead of the behavior it
    is meant to test:

    | Rollup contents | Required result |
    | --- | --- |
    | A failing non-reviewer check, plus a green one | `deferred` / `baseline_checks_not_green` |
    | A pending non-reviewer check, plus a green one | `deferred` / `baseline_checks_pending` |
    | A **pending reviewer-owned** check **plus a green non-reviewer check** | `dispatched` — the reviewer's own check was correctly excluded |
    | An empty rollup | `deferred` / `baseline_checks_unobserved` |
    | Only reviewer-owned checks | `deferred` / `baseline_checks_unobserved` |

    The third row is the reviewer-exclusion test and the fifth is the
    vacuous-green guard; they are only distinguishable because the third
    carries a green non-reviewer check. Without it both rows would return
    `baseline_checks_unobserved` and neither the row nor proof P14 could tell a
    correct exclusion from a vacuous-green miss. The last two rows are the guard
    itself: "every member is green" is trivially true of an empty set, so an
    unguarded implementation would dispatch with no baseline evidence.
11. The threads or checks query returns a live head different from
    `loop_head_sha` → `deferred` / `evidence_head_moved`. Without this, evidence
    from a newer commit could authorize dispatch against reviewer verdicts taken
    on an older one.
12. Each unreadable input in turn → `deferred` with its specific reason —
    `evidence_unavailable_head` for an empty `loop_head_sha`,
    `evidence_unavailable_review_threads` for a failed threads query,
    `evidence_unavailable_checks` for a failed check rollup.
13. The deferral cap: with the ledger already recording
    `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS` deferrals for the current
    `loop_head_sha`, the next run → `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=deferral_cap`,
    `RESULT=escalate`, `REASON=expensive_gate_deferral_cap`, and the reason that
    kept failing is still reported. With one fewer recorded deferral it defers
    normally. This is the scenario the existing dual caps cannot cover, because
    they bucket `needs_fixes` uniquely by head and result.
14. The deferral counter is head-scoped: deferrals recorded against a different
    `expensive_gate.head` do not count toward the cap for the current head, so a
    new push starts the budget over.
14b. `expensive_gate_resolve_max_deferrals` returns `3` for unset and empty;
    the configured value for `1` and `999999`; and `3` with a `WARN` on stderr
    for `0`, `-1`, `1000000`, `abc`, `2.5`, and a value with surrounding
    whitespace. `EXPENSIVE_GATE_MAX_DEFERRALS` reports the effective value in
    every case. Without validation a non-integer makes `[ -ge ]` raise
    `integer expression expected` and evaluate false, defeating the cap, while
    `0` or a negative value trips it before the first deferral and escalates
    every gated PR.
15. `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_FORCE_EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS=1` with condition 1 unmet →
    `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=forced`, `EXPENSIVE_GATE_REASON=local_evidence_stale`
    preserved, `run_platform_review` **is** called, and the aggregate is **not**
    set to `needs_fixes` — the override path of brief scope bullet 3, proving
    both that the reason survives and that an explicit human decision is not
    re-blocked.
16. Composition with the phase mechanism: a platform that is both a phase
    platform and an expensive reviewer runs `ensure_pr_ready_for_ready_phase`
    first and the gate second; when the gate defers, the PR has still been
    converted to ready and the defer is not reported as a phase failure.
17. Composition with `--pre-after-clean-only`: an expensive reviewer that is
    also a phase platform is filtered out before the gate is consulted, and the
    gate emits no telemetry for it — no phantom `deferred` record for a platform
    that was never in scope.
18. A ledger entry written without `expensive_gate` still parses through
    `reviewer_loop_history_payload_from_existing` — `v1` backward compatibility,
    same contract as #1648's added fields.
19. The deferral budget is genuinely unreadable — the history marker is present
    but its JSON block is unparseable, its schema does not match, or its
    persisted `history_status` is not `available` →
    `EXPENSIVE_GATE_RESULT=deferral_cap`,
    `REASON=expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable`,
    `EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS=-1`, and the loop escalates. Without this the
    bounded-deferral guarantee would hold only when the ledger happens to be
    readable, which is not a guarantee.
19b. The ledger is **absent** — no summary comment yet, or a body with no
    history marker — → `EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS=0` and the gate defers or
    dispatches normally. This is every PR's first reviewer-loop run; escalating
    here would bypass the bounded deferrals on every PR without prior history
    and the bound would never be exercised.

**Files**:
20. The relocation is behavior-preserving: `pr-ci-loop.sh` produces identical
    `REVIEWER_CHECK_COUNT`, `REVIEWER_CHECKS` and `REVIEWER_CHECKS_JSON` before
    and after `configured_reviewer_check_names_json` moves to
    `workflow-lib.sh`, and `expensive_gate_baseline_checks_status` classifies
    the same check names as reviewer-owned.
21. A draft-phase defer does not start the ready phase: with `codex-github` on
    draft deferring and `bugbot` on ready, the loop breaks out immediately —
    `ensure_pr_ready_for_ready_phase` is not called, `gh pr ready` is not run,
    the PR stays draft, and no `EXPENSIVE_GATE_*` or phase telemetry is emitted
    for `bugbot`. Without the short-circuit the gate would produce a visible,
    hard-to-undo side effect while refusing to proceed.
22. In-loop derivation matches the printed contract: with #1648's actual
    producer populating `platform_reviewed_heads` — not with the variables
    pre-seeded — `expensive_gate_local_ai_configured` and
    `expensive_gate_local_ai_head_current` return exactly the values the run
    later prints as `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` and `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`, for a
    current head, a stale head, an unreported head, and a run where
    `local-ai-reviewer` is not configured. This is the composition test with the
    dependency rather than a mock of it.

Every scenario is assigned to exactly one suite. The list below enumerates them
individually rather than by range, because the sub-lettered scenarios added
during review (6b, 14b, 19b) are the ones a range silently drops — and each of
them covers a fail-closed edge, which is precisely what must not go untested.

- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` — scenarios 1, 2,
  3, 4, 5, 6, 6b, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14b, 18, 19 and 19b, as new
  cases in the existing `HARNESS_MODE=1` harness.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-ci-loop.sh` — scenario 20, which
  asserts that `pr-ci-loop.sh` still produces the same `REVIEWER_CHECK_COUNT`,
  `REVIEWER_CHECKS` and `REVIEWER_CHECKS_JSON` after
  `configured_reviewer_check_names_json` moves to `workflow-lib.sh`. Its
  existing `# covers:` mapping already selects it for a `pr-ci-loop.sh` change;
  add `# covers: scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh` so a later edit
  to the relocated function also selects it.
- `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-expensive-reviewer-gate.sh` — a new
  suite for scenarios 15, 16, 17, 21 and 22 — the override and composition
  cases, which need their own mock scaffolding for the phase and filter paths.
  It must declare:

  ```text
  # covers: scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh
  # covers: docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md
  ```

  Both lines are required. In `select-test-suites.sh` the naming-convention
  fallback runs only when a suite declares nothing (`declared=0`), and the
  convention would map `test-expensive-reviewer-gate.sh` to a
  `scripts/development-workflow/expensive-reviewer-gate.sh` that does not exist,
  so this suite must declare its coverage explicitly or it would only ever run
  when the test file itself changes.

**Smoke test runbook**:
`docs/testing/workflow/1649-expensive-reviewers-after-local-clean.smoke-test.md`

**Regression suite**: The repository's regression surface is the
`workflow-tests.yml` harness selection; the two suites above are the regression
coverage for this change.

### Planted-violation proofs (mandatory before `ready-for-human-review`)

This plan adds a new automated gate, so `REVIEW.md` § Planted-violation proof
and `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md` § Planted-Violation Proofs apply, and the
pure-refactor exemption does not. Two demonstrated runs per proof, each citing a
concrete file and line:

| # | Violation to plant | Where | Check that must fail, then pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Stale local evidence: populate `platform_reviewed_heads` so the `local-ai-reviewer` entry records a 40-character OID that is **not** `loop_head_sha`, with all other conditions met | the gate fixture in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` | the gate defers with `local_evidence_stale`, `run_platform_review` is not called, and the aggregate is `needs_fixes` / `expensive_gate_deferred`; setting that entry to `loop_head_sha` dispatches |
| P2 | Missing local evidence: leave the `local-ai-reviewer` entry of `platform_reviewed_heads` absent while `local-ai-reviewer` **is** in the resolved platform list | same fixture | the gate defers with `local_evidence_missing`; adding the entry with the current head dispatches — the proof that an unknown is refused rather than assumed clean |
| P3 | Unreadable evidence: make the review-threads query fail | same fixture | the gate defers with `evidence_unavailable_review_threads` **and** the aggregate becomes `needs_fixes` / `expensive_gate_deferred`, so readiness is withheld; restoring the query dispatches and leaves the aggregate clean |
| P4 | Gate-not-wired regression: **delete the `expensive_reviewer_gate` call** from the per-platform block, leaving the function defined but unreachable | a scratch copy of the per-platform block in `scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | scenario 3 fails, because `codex-github` is dispatched with stale local evidence and no `EXPENSIVE_GATE_*` telemetry is emitted; restoring the call passes. Deleting the call is the correct mutation: removing the `is_expensive_reviewer_platform` guard instead would consult the gate for *every* platform, which is a different defect and would not leave the gate unreachable |
| P5 | Ordering regression: **delete the `reorder_expensive_reviewers_last` call**, leaving a platform list that declares `codex-github` before `pr-agent` | a scratch copy of the platform-resolution block | scenario 6 fails and scenario 7's suppressed-reorder case shows the gate deferring on every invocation with `peer_reviewer_not_run` — a deferral that can never resolve; restoring the call passes |
| P9 | Phase-bucket regression: replace the per-bucket partition with a single global one | a scratch copy of `reorder_expensive_reviewers_last` | scenario 6b fails, because a draft-configured `codex-github` is placed after the ready-phase `bugbot` and therefore runs only after `gh pr ready`; restoring the per-bucket partition passes |
| P10 | Peer-evidence regression: accept any `skipped` peer instead of applying the allow-list | a scratch copy of condition 2 | scenario 8's `unavailable`, `timeout` and `unauthorized` rows fail, because the gate dispatches with a peer that never produced a verdict; restoring the allow-list passes |
| P19 | Deny-list regression: decide acceptance solely by `reviewer_failed_label_required_for_result` returning false, dropping the `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ACCEPTED_SKIP_REASONS` membership test | same scratch copy | scenario 8's unknown-reason and empty-reason rows fail, because that helper returns false for any reason it does not recognise and a future reviewer's new skip reason would silently become acceptable evidence; restoring the membership test passes |
| P18 | Unvalidated-bound regression: pass `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS=abc` and then `=0` with the validation removed | the deferral-budget fixture in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` | with `abc` the comparison errors and the cap never trips, so scenario 13's escalation fails; with `0` every gated PR escalates before its first deferral, so scenario 3's defer fails. Restoring `expensive_gate_resolve_max_deferrals` makes both pass with the documented fallback |
| P17 | Environment-read regression: change the gate to read `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` and `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` as environment variables instead of calling the two derivation helpers | a scratch copy of condition 1 | scenario 22 fails and every condition-1 case defers with `local_evidence_missing`, because those names are stdout keys printed at end of run and are unset during the platform iteration; restoring the helpers passes |
| P16 | Vacuous-green regression: make `expensive_gate_baseline_checks_status` return `green` for an empty non-reviewer check set | a scratch copy of the helper | scenario 10's two empty cases fail, because the gate dispatches with no baseline evidence on a head whose CI has not registered; restoring the `empty` state defers with `baseline_checks_unobserved` |
| P15 | No-short-circuit regression: make a `deferred` result set the aggregate without breaking out of the platform iteration | a scratch copy of the gate call site | scenario 21 fails, because the loop continues to the ready-phase platform and calls `gh pr ready` on a PR whose draft-phase expensive reviewer never ran; restoring the break passes |
| P14 | Reviewer-check-classification regression: make `expensive_gate_baseline_checks_status` treat every check as a baseline check | a scratch copy of the helper | scenario 10's reviewer-owned-pending row fails, because `codex-github` waits on a check it is responsible for producing; restoring the `configured_reviewer_check_names_json` exclusion passes |
| P13 | Peer-set regression: widen the peer set from the preceding platforms back to every non-expensive platform in the resolved list | a scratch copy of the peer-set computation | scenario 7's first row fails, because a draft-phase `codex-github` waits on a ready-phase `bugbot` that cannot have run yet and defers until the cap; restoring the phase-scoped set passes |
| P6 | Readiness regression: make a defer leave the aggregate result unchanged instead of setting `needs_fixes` | a scratch copy of the gate call site | scenario 3's aggregate assertion fails, and a run in which `codex-github` never executed would satisfy Protocol 92's readiness conditions; restoring the `needs_fixes` aggregate passes |
| P7 | Unbounded-deferral regression: replace the head-scoped deferral counter with the existing `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count` caps | a scratch copy of the cap check | scenario 13 fails, because repeated `needs_fixes` results on one unchanged head collapse under that function's `unique` bucketing by `head_sha` + `result` and neither cap ever trips; restoring the dedicated counter escalates with `expensive_gate_deferral_cap` |
| P8 | Unreadable-budget regression: seed a malformed ledger and change the counter to treat it as a count of zero | the deferral-budget fixture in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` | scenario 19 fails, because the gate defers on an unproven budget instead of escalating; restoring the fail-closed branch escalates with `expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable` |
| P11 | Absent-ledger regression: change the counter to return `-1` for an absent ledger as well as a malformed one | same fixture | scenario 19b fails, because a PR with no prior reviewer-loop history escalates on its first run and the bound is never exercised; restoring the three-state mapping passes |
| P12 | Deny-list regression: rewrite condition 1 to reject only `0` and empty rather than requiring exactly `1` | a scratch copy of condition 1 | scenario 4's `2` and `true` rows fail, because the gate dispatches with an unrecognized evidence value; restoring the exact-match allow-list passes |

Record all nineteen in the implementation PR under a `Planted-Violation Proofs`
heading, each with the command, the file and line of the planted violation, and
both outcomes.

Every proof that touches the local evidence manipulates the **in-loop state** —
the resolved platform list and `platform_reviewed_heads` — and never exports
`LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` or `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`. Those names are stdout keys
the gate is required to ignore, so a proof that set them would validate an
interface the implementation must not have, and would contradict P17.

### Parser-risk addendum

Not applicable. The gate compares tokens the loop already produces
(`LOCAL_AI_*` values, platform names, check conclusions) and performs no
text scanning, regex extraction, or structured-text parsing of its own. Review
threads and check conclusions are read through `gh --jq`, which is existing
parsing this plan does not modify.

### Concurrent-event-source addendum

Not applicable. The gate is evaluated synchronously inside the loop's existing
sequential per-platform iteration, holds no state between invocations, and
introduces no listeners, timers, or async callbacks. The one shared mutable
input is the per-invocation record of peer reviewer verdicts, which is written
by the same sequential block that already writes `platform_result_tokens`.

## Seed Data

| Entity | Values / Scenario | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gate condition fixture | A table-driven set of the conditions with each one independently unmet, plus the six-row unexpected-value table for condition 1, driving scenarios 2–5 and 9–11 | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Platform-order fixture | A resolved list declaring `codex-github` first, an already-correct list, and a two-bucket list with `codex-github` on draft and `bugbot` on ready — driving scenarios 6, 6b and 7 | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Peer-evidence fixture | One peer per row of scenario 8's table: `clean`, the four accepted skip reasons, the three rejected skip reasons, an unknown skip reason, an empty skip reason, `needs_fixes` and `escalate` | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Unreadable-input mocks | Mock `gh` commands that exit non-zero for the threads query and for the check rollup, plus a rollup that returns an empty array and one containing only reviewer-owned checks — driving scenarios 10 and 12 and proofs P3 and P16 | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Deferral-budget fixtures | Ledger payloads carrying `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS` `expensive_gate.result=deferred` entries at the current head, one fewer, the same count at a different head, and an unparseable payload — driving scenarios 13, 14, 19 and 19b and proofs P7, P8 and P11 — including an absent ledger, a malformed one, and a well-formed one | inline heredocs in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Composition fixture | A platform list where `codex-github` is both a phase platform and an expensive reviewer, driving scenarios 16 and 17 | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-expensive-reviewer-gate.sh` |
| Legacy ledger payload | A `reviewer_loop_history.v1` entry with no `expensive_gate` object, driving scenario 18 | inline heredoc in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |

No repository fixture files are added; both suites build their fixtures inline
with mock `gh` commands and require no network access.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`
      — document the gate: its conditions and evaluation order, the
      order-independence of condition 2 and how its peer set is scoped by phase
      bucket, the head binding of conditions 3 and 4,
      the fail-closed rule, the `deferred` outcome setting the aggregate to
      `needs_fixes` so readiness is withheld and Step 7 re-runs, the bounded
      deferral counter with both of its escalation values and the
      `deferral_cap`-only emission of `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION`, the
      reordering of expensive reviewers last **within their own phase bucket**
      (never across the draft/ready boundary), and the override variable.
- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/codex-github.md` — add a
      section describing the gate, its conditions, the override, and the same
      two-value `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` contract (`expensive_gate_deferral_cap`,
      `expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable`, emitted only on a
      `deferral_cap` result), so the gate is fully discoverable from the
      reviewer's own integration page rather than only from the loop protocol.
- [ ] `REVIEW.md` — no change. The gate decides when a reviewer runs, not what
      the review contract requires.
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — no change. It does not enumerate reviewer-loop gates.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A misconfigured deferral bound defeats or inverts the cap | Med | High — a non-integer makes the comparison error and evaluate false so the cap never trips, while `0` escalates every gated PR before its first deferral | `expensive_gate_resolve_max_deferrals` validates to a positive integer in `1`–`999999`, `WARN`s and falls back to `3` otherwise, and mirrors `reviewer_loop_resolve_max_cycles` so the script has one convention rather than two; the effective value is emitted as `EXPENSIVE_GATE_MAX_DEFERRALS`. Scenario 14b and proof P18 pin both failure directions |
| The gate silently stops `codex-github` from ever running | Med | High — the expensive reviewer's findings are the reason this epic exists; losing them entirely is worse than running it too often | A defer is never terminal and never unbounded: it sets the aggregate to `needs_fixes` / `expensive_gate_deferred` so readiness is withheld and Step 7 re-runs, and a head-scoped counter escalates with `expensive_gate_deferral_cap` after `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS` deferrals so a stuck gate reaches a human. Every defer names one reason in both the summary comment and the ledger, and `EXPENSIVE_GATE_DEFERRALS` shows the distance to the cap before it trips. Scenarios 3, 13 and 14 pin the three halves |
| A deferral loop is invisible to the existing cycle caps | Med | High — the gate could cycle indefinitely on one unchanged head with neither cap advancing | `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count` buckets qualifying entries `unique` over `head_sha + "\|" + result`, so repeated `needs_fixes` on one head counts once; the plan therefore adds its own occurrence-counted, head-scoped deferral counter rather than relying on those caps, and proof P7 plants the reliance to demonstrate that it does not bound anything |
| A consumer that never configures a local reviewer is blocked forever | Med | High — downstream template consumers would stall | The brief requires fail-closed on missing local evidence, so the gate defers rather than inventing an implicit dispatch. The release valves are explicit: the deferral cap escalates to a human after a bounded number of tries, and `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_FORCE_EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS` covers a one-off run. Scenario 5 pins the defer and scenario 13 the escalation |
| The gate is defined but never consulted, leaving behavior unchanged | Med | High — the item would appear complete while changing nothing | The call site is in the per-platform block immediately before `run_platform_review`, and proof P4 deletes that call outright and requires scenario 3 to fail — a gate that is not wired in cannot pass its own proof |
| Fail-closed on unreadable evidence turns a transient API blip into a permanent defer | Med | Med | A defer is per-invocation, not sticky: the `needs_fixes` aggregate makes Protocol 91 re-run Step 7, which re-evaluates from scratch. The bound is the gate's own head-scoped deferral counter, not the existing dual cycle caps — those cannot see a deferral loop, as the Verification Log records — and an unreadable budget escalates rather than deferring again. The gate adds no retry path of its own, so it cannot loop |
| A defer still triggers the ready-phase transition | Med | High — `gh pr ready` would convert the PR out of draft even though the draft-phase expensive reviewer never ran, a visible side effect from a gate that refused to proceed | A `deferred` or `deferral_cap` outcome breaks out of the platform iteration immediately, exactly as the existing non-clean short-circuit does, so no later platform is considered; scenario 21 and proof P15 pin it |
| The gate contradicts the existing phase mechanism | Med | High — two gates disagreeing on whether a platform runs is worse than either alone | Composition is specified explicitly (phase gate first, then this gate; `--pre-after-clean-only` filters before both) and pinned by scenarios 16 and 17, including the no-phantom-telemetry case |
| Implementation starts before #1648 lands and wires the gate to keys that do not exist | Med | High — the gate would read unset variables and hold everything, or be written against a guessed contract | Recorded as a Conflict in the Cross-Cutting check and as Implementation Order step 0, which is a hard stop that verifies #1648 is merged into the approved base before any edit |
| An empty check set reads as green | Med | High — a snapshot taken before CI registers on the new head would dispatch with no baseline evidence, inverting the fail-closed contract by a quantifier | Condition 4 requires the non-reviewer set to be **non-empty** as well as all-green; an empty set defers with `baseline_checks_unobserved`. The gate does not guess whether the repository has no CI or the checks have not registered — both defer, and the deferral cap sends the genuinely-no-CI case to a human, which is the right owner for "run an expensive reviewer with no CI". Scenario 10's two empty cases and proof P16 pin it |
| A reviewer's own check gates that reviewer | Low | Med — `codex-github` would wait on a check it is responsible for producing | Condition 4 evaluates non-reviewer checks only, excluding the names returned by `configured_reviewer_check_names_json`, which moves from `pr-ci-loop.sh` to `workflow-lib.sh` so both callers share one definition rather than two drifting copies; scenario 10's third case and proof P14 pin it |
| The shared classification is duplicated or the gate blocks on the CI loop | Med | Med — a duplicated copy drifts, and calling `pr-ci-loop.sh` would make a snapshot gate poll | The plan names the exact function, the exact destination file, the fact that both scripts already source it, and an explicit prohibition on invoking `pr-ci-loop.sh` from the gate; scenario 20 asserts the relocation is behavior-preserving |
| Platform ordering decides whether the gate is effective | Med | High — a config listing `codex-github` first would either dispatch it before the cheap reviewers ran, or defer at the same point forever | Detection is not enough, so the loop reorders: `reorder_expensive_reviewers_last` moves expensive platforms to the end of their own bucket before iteration, making the gate's precondition reachable; condition 2's peer set is computed from the reordered list, so `peer_reviewer_not_run` fires as a defensive assertion if the reorder did not happen. Scenarios 6 and 7 and proof P5 pin both halves |
| The peer set and the phase-bucket reorder contradict each other | Med | High — a draft-phase expensive reviewer would wait on a ready-phase peer that cannot have run yet, deadlocking until the cap | The peer set is the platforms that *precede* this reviewer under the reordered list — its own bucket's non-expensive platforms plus every earlier bucket — rather than the whole resolved list; scenario 7's table and proof P13 pin it, including the draft-plus-ready configuration |
| The reorder silently moves a reviewer across the draft/ready boundary | Med | High — a draft-configured expensive reviewer would run only after `gh pr ready`, inverting the configuration contract | The partition is per phase bucket, assigned with the existing `is_phase_after_clean_platform` predicate, and the buckets are concatenated in their original order; scenario 6b and proof P9 pin it |
| The gate reads the local evidence from the environment and always defers | Med | High — #1648's `LOCAL_AI_*` are stdout keys printed at end of run, so an environment read is unset during the loop and the gate would refuse on every invocation | Both values are derived at gate time from the in-loop state #1648 already maintains — platform-list membership and `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify` over `platform_reviewed_heads` — with the stdout keys as the serialization of that same state rather than a second source. Scenario 22 composes with #1648's real producer instead of pre-seeding, and proof P17 plants the environment read |
| An unrecognized evidence value falls through condition 1 | Med | High — a `2` or a stray `true` would authorize the expensive reviewer with no valid local-clean evidence, the exact opposite of fail-closed | Condition 1 is an exact-match allow-list requiring the literal `1` on both keys, not a deny-list on `0` and empty; anything else reports `local_evidence_missing`. Scenario 4's eight-row table and proof P12 pin it |
| A peer that never produced a verdict is accepted as evidence | Med | High — `codex-github` would dispatch with no cheap pre-filter having actually run, which is the state the item exists to prevent | Acceptance is a positive allow-list, `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ACCEPTED_SKIP_REASONS`, plus a confirming `reviewer_failed_label_required_for_result` call. A helper-only rule would be a deny-list: that helper returns false for any reason it does not recognise, so an unknown, empty, or newly-introduced skip reason would silently become acceptable. Scenario 8's table and proofs P10 and P19 pin both halves |
| Thread and CI evidence describes a newer commit than the reviewer verdicts | Med | High — dispatch would be authorized on an inconsistent mix of two heads | Conditions 3 and 4 require the live head returned with their queries to equal `loop_head_sha`, and defer with `evidence_head_moved` otherwise; scenario 11 pins it |

## Code Samples

The snippet below uses Bash arrays (`EXPENSIVE_REVIEWER_PLATFORMS`,
`EXPENSIVE_GATE_ACCEPTED_SKIP_REASONS`) and `local` declarations, matching
`pr-review-loop.sh`'s own `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang. It is not portable to
POSIX `sh`, so its contract is `bash` rather than `bash-zsh`.

**Expensive reviewer gate:** codex-github — deferred (local_evidence_stale) at head `6780c658eebc8879d61e56842445749c1195b13f`. The reviewer was not run; this loop result is `needs_fixes` so readiness is withheld and Step 7 will re-run.

## Implementation Order

0. **Hard stop — dependency check.** Confirm #1648 is merged into
   `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` and that
   `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` / `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` exist in
   `pr-review-loop.sh` on the base branch. **Verify**:
   `gh pr view 1660 --json state,baseRefName` returns `MERGED` with the
   integration branch as base, and `grep -n 'LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED'
   scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` on the rebased branch
   returns a hit. If either fails, stop and report — do not implement against a
   guessed contract.
1. Add `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWER_PLATFORMS` and `is_expensive_reviewer_platform` near
   the existing `is_phase_after_clean_platform` helper. **Verify**: source with
   `HARNESS_MODE=1` and confirm scenario 1's matches and non-matches.
2. Add `reorder_expensive_reviewers_last`, called once after the platform list
   is resolved and before iteration, partitioning **within each phase bucket**
   using `is_phase_after_clean_platform`, and emit
   `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS_REORDERED` when it changed the order. **Verify**:
   scenario 6 — a list declaring `codex-github` first ends with it last,
   relative order is otherwise preserved, and an already-correct list is
   untouched with the flag unset; scenario 6b — a draft-configured expensive
   reviewer still precedes every ready-phase platform.
3. Add `expensive_gate_deferral_count`, reading occurrences of
   `expensive_gate.result == "deferred"` scoped to `expensive_gate.head` from
   the ledger, returning `0` for an absent ledger or a body with no history
   marker, and `-1` only for a marker whose JSON is unparseable, whose schema
   does not match, or whose persisted `history_status` is not `available` —
   mirroring `reviewer_loop_history_entries_count`'s own three states.
   **Verify**: scenarios 13, 14, 19 and 19b — the count reflects only the
   current head, an absent ledger yields `0`, and a malformed one yields `-1`.
3.0 Add `expensive_gate_resolve_max_deferrals`, mirroring
   `reviewer_loop_resolve_max_cycles`: default `3`, accept `1`–`999999`,
   `WARN` and fall back on anything else, resolved once per run. **Verify**:
   scenario 14b covers unset, empty, both bounds, and five rejected forms.
3a. Add `expensive_gate_local_ai_configured` (membership of
   `local-ai-reviewer` in the resolved `platforms[@]`) and
   `expensive_gate_local_ai_head_current <head_sha>` (which applies #1648's
   `reviewer_loop_head_evidence_classify` to the `local-ai-reviewer` entry of
   `platform_reviewed_heads`). **Verify**: scenario 22 — with #1648's real
   producer populating `platform_reviewed_heads`, both helpers return the same
   values the run later prints as `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` and
   `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT`. Do not read those names as environment variables.
3b. Move `configured_reviewer_check_names_json` verbatim from `pr-ci-loop.sh`
   to `workflow-lib.sh`, delete the local definition, and add
   `expensive_gate_baseline_checks_status`. **Verify**: scenario 20 — the CI
   loop's three reviewer-check outputs are unchanged, and the new helper
   classifies the same names as reviewer-owned. Do not call `pr-ci-loop.sh`
   from the gate.
4. Add `expensive_reviewer_gate` with the conditions in the documented order,
   condition 2 computing the peer set from the reordered list and this
   reviewer's index in it and deciding acceptance by
   `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ACCEPTED_SKIP_REASONS` membership confirmed by
   `reviewer_failed_label_required_for_result`, the live-head comparison
   for conditions 3 and 4, the fail-closed branch for every unreadable input,
   and the deferral-cap branch. **Verify**: drive the condition fixture and
   confirm each unmet condition yields its single named reason, and that the
   cap escalates rather than deferring a fourth time.
5. Wire the gate into the per-platform block immediately before
   `run_platform_review`, guarded by `is_expensive_reviewer_platform`. A
   `deferred` result sets the aggregate to `needs_fixes` with
   `REASON=expensive_gate_deferred`; a `deferral_cap` result sets it to
   `escalate` with `REASON=expensive_gate_deferral_cap`, or
   `REASON=expensive_gate_deferral_budget_unreadable` when the counter returned
   `-1`. Both **break out of the platform iteration** so no later platform is
   considered. **Verify**: scenario 3 shows `run_platform_review` is not called
   and the aggregate is `needs_fixes`; scenarios 13 and 19 show both
   escalations; scenario 21 shows `gh pr ready` is not called after a
   draft-phase defer.
6. Add the override branch, confirm the reason survives it, and confirm a
   `forced` result does **not** set the `needs_fixes` aggregate. **Verify**:
   scenario 15.
7. Emit the `EXPENSIVE_GATE_*` keys — including `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION`,
   which is emitted only on a `deferral_cap` result — and
   `EXPENSIVE_REVIEWERS_REORDERED`, and document them in `--help`.
   **Verify**: run `pr-review-loop.sh --help` and confirm the gate, its
   conditions, the fail-closed rule, the `deferred` aggregate behavior, the
   reordering, `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_MAX_EXPENSIVE_DEFERRALS`,
   `EXPENSIVE_GATE_ESCALATION` with both of its values and its
   `deferral_cap`-only emission, and the override variable are described.
8. Add the summary-comment line and the `expensive_gate` ledger object
   (`platform`, `result`, `reason`, `head`). **Verify**: build an entry in the
   harness and confirm the object shape, that `expensive_gate_deferral_count`
   reads it back, and that a legacy entry without it still parses
   (scenario 18).
9. Update
   `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`
   and
   `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/codex-github.md` per
   **Documentation Updates**. **Verify**: both files describe the same four
   conditions, the same fail-closed rule, and the same override variable name.
10. Add the unit cases to `test-pr-review-loop.sh` and create
    `test-expensive-reviewer-gate.sh` with both `# covers:` lines, and add the
    `workflow-lib.sh` `# covers:` line to `test-pr-ci-loop.sh`.
    **Verify**: all **three** suites exit 0 —
    `test-pr-review-loop.sh`, `test-expensive-reviewer-gate.sh` and
    `test-pr-ci-loop.sh`, the last of which carries scenario 20 and is the only
    check that the classification relocation preserved behavior — and
    `scripts/development-workflow/select-test-suites.sh` selects the new suite
    for a change touching only `pr-review-loop.sh` and selects
    `test-pr-ci-loop.sh` for a change touching only `workflow-lib.sh`.
11. Produce the nineteen planted-violation proofs (P1–P19) and record them in the PR
    under a `Planted-Violation Proofs` heading. **Verify**: each shows two runs
    at a concrete file and line — failing with the violation planted, passing
    once removed.
12. Run `shellcheck` on **all three** changed shell files —
    `scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh`,
    `scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh` (the relocation removes a
    function from it) and `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh` (it
    gains that function) — and `markdownlint-cli2` on **both** changed
    documentation targets,
    `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`
    and `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/codex-github.md`, plus
    this plan and the runbook. **Verify**: both tools exit 0 on every file
    named here; the enumeration is explicit so a changed file cannot be omitted
    by reading "the changed script" narrowly.
13. Add a changelog fragment
    `changelog.d/1649.changed.expensive-reviewers-after-local-clean.md`
    containing exactly:

    ```markdown
    - **Gate expensive reviewers on current-head local evidence** (#1649): `codex-github` now runs only after the local reviewer is clean on the current head, every reviewer that precedes it has produced acceptable evidence, review threads are resolved, and non-reviewer checks are green — and defers fail-closed, with a bounded retry budget, when that evidence is missing or stale.
    ```

14. Update project docs per **Documentation Updates** above (step 9 covers
    them; no other project doc is affected).
