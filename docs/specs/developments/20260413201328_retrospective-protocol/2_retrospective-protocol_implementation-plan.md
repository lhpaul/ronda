# Retrospective Protocol — Implementation Plan

**Spec**: [1_retrospective-protocol_specs.md](1_retrospective-protocol_specs.md)
**Smoke test runbook**: [retrospective-protocol.smoke-test.md](../../../testing/workflow/retrospective-protocol.smoke-test.md)

---

## Summary

**Approach**: Add a new protocol document (`06-retrospective-protocol.md`) that defines the retrospective analysis flow, then integrate post-merge retrospective suggestion hooks into Protocols 90 and 91 (deferred until after the human confirms PRs are merged, not at the Step 6 summary point). Create the `/retrospective` command/skill across all three supported platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) following the existing patterns for each. Finally, update the workflow README and AGENTS.md to reference the new protocol and command.

**Estimated complexity**: S

<!-- S: < 1 day | M: 1-3 days | L: 3+ days -->

**Rationale**: All deliverables are Markdown documentation and platform configuration files. No code, database, or infrastructure changes. All platform patterns (Claude Code commands, Cursor agents, Codex skills) are well-established and can be copied from existing examples.

**Dependencies**: None

## Layer-by-Layer Changes

### Protocol Document

- [ ] Create `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06-retrospective-protocol.md` — the core retrospective protocol document covering:
  - Protocol metadata (agent role, purpose)
  - Step 1: Resolve scope — determine which PRs to analyze (from scope hint, current session, or recent repo PRs)
  - Step 2: Gather data — query GitHub PR metadata (review cycles, finding types, labels, merge conflicts) and git history (commit patterns, fix-commit ratio); when conversation context is available, also analyze manual interventions, human corrections, agent deviations
  - Step 3: Synthesize findings — Step 3a queries the configured issue tracker for existing open items that may overlap with findings (tracker-agnostic via `issue_tracker.provider` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`); Step 3b categorizes improvement opportunities using the fixed taxonomy (`workflow-process`, `agent-behavior`, `configuration`, `documentation`, `code-quality`, `tooling`), assigns severity signals (`high`, `medium`, `low`), recommends an action for each, and records a related existing item reference (or "none") per finding
  - Step 4: Present and act — show categorized findings to the human; each finding includes a "Related existing item" field; for each, accept the human's choice of "Address now", "Add to backlog", or "Skip"; execute the chosen action
  - Step 5: Execute actions — "Address now": apply simple fix, commit, push (no new PR or review loop); "Add to backlog": when a related item exists, offer "Expand existing" (append to the existing issue body) or "Create new" (create a new GitHub issue with the `workflow` label); when no related item exists, create a new issue directly; "Skip": move on
  - Step 6: Close — confirm what was done and end the retrospective
  - Graceful exit when no actionable findings are surfaced
  - Constraint: the agent never applies fixes or creates issues without the human's explicit choice
  - Maps to: AC 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13

### Integration into Existing Protocols

- [x] Update `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` — Step 6 does NOT immediately suggest a retrospective after the batch summary (which is shown at `ready-for-human-review` state, before merge). Instead, defers the suggestion until after the human confirms batch PRs have been merged (via `/batch-merge`, `/post-merge-cleanup`, or explicit signal). Maps to: AC 9
- [x] Update `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` — Step 6 does NOT immediately suggest a retrospective after the item summary. Defers until after the human confirms the PR has been merged (via `/post-merge-cleanup` or explicit signal). When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`, suppress the suggestion entirely. Maps to: AC 10

### Platform Commands / Skills

- [ ] Create `.claude/commands/retrospective.md` — Claude Code command following the pattern of existing commands (e.g., `run-reviewer-loop.md`). Points to `06-retrospective-protocol.md` as the canonical source. Maps to: AC 11
- [ ] Create `.cursor/agents/retrospective.md` — Cursor agent following the pattern of existing agents (e.g., `orchestrator.md`). Points to `06-retrospective-protocol.md`. Maps to: AC 11
- [ ] Create `.codex/skills/workflow-retrospective/SKILL.md` — Codex skill following the pattern of existing skills (e.g., `workflow-reviewer-loop/SKILL.md`). Points to `06-retrospective-protocol.md`. Maps to: AC 11
- [ ] Create `.codex/skills/workflow-retrospective/agents/openai.yaml` — Codex agent metadata following the pattern of existing agents. Maps to: AC 11

## Testing Strategy

**Test types**: Smoke / Manual

**Key scenarios to test**:

1. Invoke `/retrospective` in a fresh session with no scope hint — verify the agent queries recent PRs, presents categorized findings (or closes gracefully if none), and respects the human's choice for each (AC 1, 2, 3, 4, 12)
2. Invoke `/retrospective` with a specific PR number as scope hint — verify findings are scoped to that PR (AC 1)
3. Choose "Address now" for a simple finding — verify fix is applied, committed, and pushed without a new PR (AC 5)
4. Choose "Address now" for a complex finding — verify agent recommends "Add to backlog" instead and explains why (AC 6)
5. Choose "Add to backlog" for a finding with no related existing item — verify a new GitHub issue is created with the `workflow` label, descriptive title/body, and the URL is returned (AC 7)
   5b. Choose "Add to backlog" for a finding with a related existing item — verify the agent offers "Expand existing" vs "Create new"; choosing "Expand existing" appends the observation to the existing issue body and returns the updated URL (AC 13)
6. Complete a batch run via Protocol 90, verify retrospective is NOT suggested after the batch summary, then confirm PRs are merged and verify retrospective is now suggested (AC 9)
7. Complete a standalone item run via Protocol 91, verify retrospective is NOT suggested immediately after the item summary, then confirm PR is merged and verify retrospective is now suggested (AC 10)
8. Complete a dispatched (non-standalone) item run via Protocol 91 and verify retrospective is NOT suggested (AC 10)
9. Run retrospective in the same session as a completed batch/item and verify conversation-context findings are surfaced alongside GitHub findings (AC 8)

**Smoke test runbook**: [`docs/testing/workflow/retrospective-protocol.smoke-test.md`](../../../testing/workflow/retrospective-protocol.smoke-test.md)

## Seed Data

No seed data is required. The retrospective protocol operates on existing GitHub PR data and git history already present in the repository.

---

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] `docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md` — add `06-retrospective-protocol.md` to the Core Protocols list and add a `/retrospective` row to the Commands By Stage table
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — add a `/retrospective` row to the Workflow Commands table and the Maintenance Commands or a new "Analysis" section

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                                   | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol 90/91 integration text conflicts with other in-flight changes | Low        | Low    | Changes are additive (appended to existing Step 6 sections); merge conflicts are easy to resolve                      |
| "Address now" action could make unintended changes                     | Low        | Medium | Protocol explicitly constrains "Address now" to simple, self-assessed-safe changes; complex items redirect to backlog |
