# Missed-Finding Telemetry — Spec

**Depends on**: 1648-reviewer-loop-current-head-evidence

---

## Overview

The reviewer loop runs a cheap local reviewer before it runs slow external ones, on the premise that front-loading findings costs fewer review rounds. Nobody can currently say whether that premise holds. The loop records that each reviewer ran and what it concluded, but not the one thing that would settle the question: how often an external reviewer finds something blocking on a pull request the local reviewer had already called clean.

This feature records exactly that. When an external reviewer reports blocking findings on a pull request where the local reviewer had previously reported clean, the loop writes a compact record of the miss into the pull request's reviewer-loop history — which reviewer found it, on which commit, how many findings and where, and what the local reviewer's verdict had been at the time. The record is deliberately conservative: it claims a miss only when the local reviewer demonstrably said clean, and says so plainly when the evidence is too weak to make the claim. Its purpose is measurement, and a measurement that inflates its own numbers is worthless — which is why a clean verdict on an *earlier* commit is recorded as a possible miss rather than a confirmed one.

## Issue-Objective Traceability

The objectives below are the discrete requirements stated in issue #1651. Every
one maps to acceptance criteria and use cases here, or to an explicit entry
under **Out of Scope (MVP)** with a deferral note. No objective is dropped.

| # | Objective (from #1651) | Where it is satisfied |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | *Problem* — quantify whether the local reviewer reduces external rounds, by tracking what external reviewers found after a local clean result | Use Cases 1-6; the counting rule and the record-every-qualifying-round rule in Business Rules; the Decision Matrix rows 5-8; AC-1 through AC-7 and AC-7a |
| 2 | *Outcome* — the reviewer-loop history records missed-by-local findings when an external reviewer reports blockers after a local clean result | Use Case 1; AC-1 through AC-3; Operational Visibility, reviewer-loop history |
| 3 | *Scope* — capture the reviewer | AC-1; Use Case 1, Information shown |
| 4 | *Scope* — capture the head commit | AC-1; the attribution rule in Business Rules; AC-11 for the case where it cannot be established |
| 5 | *Scope* — capture the finding count | AC-1 |
| 6 | *Scope* — capture the paths | AC-1; AC-14 bounds how many are shown |
| 7 | *Scope* — capture whether the local reviewer was clean on the same head or an ancestor | AC-1 through AC-4, AC-17 and AC-17a — the distinction decides confirmed versus possible miss; Use Case 3; the four clean-verdict states — same, ancestor, descendant, and unrelated — which Business Rules forbid merging |
| 8 | *Scope* — keep the record compact enough for PR comments | AC-13, AC-14, AC-14a and AC-15, with character and path bounds rather than an adjective, and an explicit precedence rule between them; Use Case 6, Considerations |
| 9 | *Scope* — support later effectiveness reporting | AC-16 (records readable in full without re-running a reviewer); the report itself is **deferred** to Out of Scope item 1 (#1657) |

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: An external reviewer finds something the local reviewer cleared

**Actor**: The reviewer loop, running on behalf of the agent or maintainer advancing a pull request.
**Preconditions**: The pull request has an existing reviewer-loop history. The local reviewer's **most recent** verdict on this pull request is clean. An external reviewer — any configured reviewer other than the local one — has now reported at least one blocking finding.

**Steps**:

1. The external reviewer returns a result carrying blocking findings.
2. The loop looks back at the local reviewer's most recent verdict for this pull request.
3. It establishes whether that verdict was clean, and whether it described the same commit the external reviewer just reviewed or an earlier one.
4. It writes a missed-finding record into the pull request's reviewer-loop history.
5. It shows the record in the reviewer-loop summary on the pull request.

**Postconditions**: The pull request carries a durable, machine-readable record of the miss alongside the history the loop already keeps. When the clean verdict covered the exact commit reviewed, the record is a confirmed miss; when it covered an ancestor, a possible miss, counted separately. Nothing about the review outcome changes — the findings are handled exactly as they are today, and the record neither blocks nor unblocks anything.

**Information shown**:

- Which external reviewer reported the findings.
- The commit it reviewed.
- How many blocking findings it reported, and which files they touched.
- What the local reviewer's verdict had been, and whether it covered the same commit or an earlier one.

**Actions available**:

- None. The record is evidence, not a prompt. A human reading it may choose to act on the pattern it reveals, but the loop asks nothing of them.

**Considerations**:

- A pull request can accumulate several missed-finding records, one per external reviewer round that qualifies. They accumulate rather than overwrite, because the shape of the sequence is itself the signal.
- The record must survive the pull request being re-reviewed, force-pushed, or converted between draft and ready, since the history it lives in already does.

---

### Use Case 2: An external reviewer finds something, but the local reviewer never cleared it

**Actor**: The reviewer loop.
**Preconditions**: An external reviewer has reported blocking findings, and the local reviewer's most recent verdict for this pull request was anything other than clean — it reported findings, was skipped, was unavailable, or never ran at all.

**Steps**:

1. The external reviewer returns a result carrying blocking findings.
2. The loop looks back at the local reviewer's most recent verdict.
3. It finds no clean verdict to have been missed against.
4. It writes a record that names what the local evidence actually was, and does not count the findings as missed.

**Postconditions**: The history records that an external reviewer found something and that no local clean verdict preceded it. The effectiveness numbers are unaffected.

**Information shown**:

- The same reviewer, commit, count and paths as Use Case 1.
- The local evidence state, stated explicitly rather than left blank — the local reviewer reported findings, was skipped, was unavailable, or never ran.

**Considerations**:

- This is the common case early in a pull request's life, and it must not be mistaken for a miss. A reviewer that never claimed the code was clean cannot have missed anything.
- The distinction matters most when the local reviewer was *unavailable*. An unavailable reviewer looks superficially like a reviewer that found nothing, and conflating the two would make an outage read as a quality failure.

---

### Use Case 3: The local reviewer was clean, but not on the code that was reviewed

**Actor**: The reviewer loop.
**Preconditions**: An external reviewer has reported blocking findings, and the local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean — but on a commit that is a descendant of, or has no ancestry relationship to, the commit the external reviewer reviewed.

**Steps**:

1. The external reviewer returns a result carrying blocking findings.
2. The loop looks back at the local reviewer's most recent verdict and finds it clean.
3. It compares that verdict's commit with the one the external reviewer reviewed, and finds the local verdict describes newer code, or code on a different line of history.
4. It writes a record naming the relationship, and does not count the findings as missed.

**Postconditions**: The history records that an external reviewer found something and that the local clean verdict did not cover the reviewed code. The effectiveness numbers are unaffected.

**Information shown**:

- The same reviewer, commit, count and paths as Use Case 1.
- The relationship between the two commits, stated as `clean_later_commit` or `clean_unrelated_commit` rather than collapsed into a generic "clean".

**Considerations**:

- The descendant case is ordinary: the local reviewer runs on each new push, so it routinely holds a clean verdict on newer code than a slower external reviewer is still reporting on. Counting it would attribute a miss to a reviewer that never saw the code in question.
- The unrelated case arises after a force-push rewrites history. It is rarer, and it is separated rather than folded into the descendant case because the two say different things about what happened to the branch.
- Both states are recorded rather than skipped, because they belong in the denominator. A pull request where the local reviewer is simply running ahead of the external one is not evidence of a miss, but it is evidence the loop ran.

---

### Use Case 4: The local evidence cannot be established

**Actor**: The reviewer loop.
**Preconditions**: An external reviewer has reported blocking findings. The reviewer-loop history is readable and can be appended to, but it does not establish what the local reviewer's most recent verdict was — it predates the point where the loop began recording the evidence this feature reads, or the relevant entries are absent.

**Steps**:

1. The external reviewer returns a result carrying blocking findings.
2. The loop reads the history successfully but finds nothing that establishes the local reviewer's most recent verdict.
3. It writes a record whose local evidence state is `unknown`.

**Postconditions**: The history records the external findings and records that the local evidence could not be established. The findings are **not** counted as missed.

**Information shown**:

- The reviewer, commit, count and paths.
- An explicit `unknown` local evidence state, distinguishable from every state in which the evidence *was* established.

**Considerations**:

- Not counting is the conservative direction here, and it is deliberate. A miss recorded on absent evidence would overstate the local reviewer's failures, and the entire value of this record is that its numbers can be trusted.
- `unknown` must be distinguishable from "the local reviewer ran and found nothing" and from "the record is missing". A reader who cannot tell those apart cannot use the data.
- `unknown` describes **missing evidence inside a healthy history**. It is not the state for a history that could not be read or written at all — that case cannot produce a record of any kind, and is Use Case 5.

---

### Use Case 5: The history itself cannot be read or written

**Actor**: The reviewer loop.
**Preconditions**: A record was owed and could not be written. Specifically: an external reviewer other than the local one has reported **blocking** findings, the commit it reviewed **can** be established, and the reviewer-loop history surface on the pull request is unavailable — it cannot be read, it does not parse, or it cannot be appended to. If any of the first two conditions does not hold, no record was owed and this use case does not apply, whatever state the history is in.

**Steps**:

1. The external reviewer returns a result carrying blocking findings.
2. The loop attempts to read or append to the reviewer-loop history and fails.
3. It writes **no** missed-finding record, and does not attempt to reconstruct or replace the history.
4. It reports that telemetry could not be recorded for this round, and why.

**Postconditions**: No record exists for this round. The existing history, whatever state it is in, is left exactly as it was. The review outcome is unchanged — the external findings are handled exactly as they are today.

**Information shown**:

- That missed-finding telemetry was not recorded for this round, and the reason.

**Actions available**:

- None from the loop. A human may repair the history surface; the loop does not.

**Considerations**:

- This is deliberately distinct from Use Case 4. There, the history is healthy and simply does not say what the local reviewer concluded, so an `unknown` record is both possible and useful. Here nothing can be written at all, so `unknown` is not available as an outcome — a state that describes evidence cannot be recorded when the place it would be recorded is the thing that failed.
- The loop must not append to, rebuild, or overwrite a history it could not read. A partial or reconstructed history would silently discard prior evidence, which is worse than a gap: a gap is visible, and a rewritten history looks authoritative.
- The omission must be visible in the round's output rather than silent. Telemetry that can disappear without anyone noticing cannot be trusted later, which is the same reason the `unknown` state exists at all.
- The report is owed **only when a record was owed**. A round carrying the local reviewer's own findings, or only advisory findings, or findings on a commit that cannot be established, terminates before history writability is ever considered — reporting a telemetry failure there would raise an alarm about a record nobody was going to write.

---

### Use Case 6: A human or a later report reads the accumulated records

**Actor**: A maintainer reading the pull request, or the reviewer-effectiveness report built on this data.
**Preconditions**: The pull request has one or more missed-finding records in its reviewer-loop history.

**Steps**:

1. The reader opens the reviewer-loop summary on the pull request, or a later report reads the history directly.
2. They see each qualifying external round, its local evidence state, and its finding count and paths.

**Postconditions**: The reader can tell, for this pull request, how many times an external reviewer found something after the local reviewer said clean, and on which commits.

**Information shown**:

- One line per missed-finding record in the summary, compact enough to read without expanding anything.
- The full structured record in the history, for a report to consume.

**Considerations**:

- The summary comment already carries the reviewer-loop history and is close to the length a human will read. The missed-finding lines must not push it past that, which is why the record is per-round rather than per-finding.

---

## Business Rules

- A finding is a **confirmed miss** only when the local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean on the **exact commit** the external reviewer reviewed — state `clean_same_commit`. That is the only state in which the local reviewer demonstrably examined the code the finding is about.
- A finding is a **possible miss** when that verdict was clean on an **ancestor** of the reviewed commit — state `clean_earlier_commit`. Possible misses are counted and reported separately and never folded into the confirmed count, because the flagged code may have arrived after the commit the local reviewer cleared.
- Both rules enumerate the states that qualify rather than the states that do not, so a state introduced later qualifies for neither until someone deliberately includes it.
- The local evidence state is recorded on every external round that reports blocking findings **and whose reviewed commit can be established**, whether or not it counts as a miss. A record that only appeared for confirmed misses would make the denominator unknowable, and a rate needs both halves. Two cases are exceptions and produce no record at all. First, an unattributable commit: a record that cannot name the commit it describes would corrupt the denominator rather than complete it. Second, a history that cannot be read, parsed, or appended to: there is nowhere to write the record, and the loop must not reconstruct or overwrite the history to make room for one. Both are enumerated here and in the Decision Matrix, and there are no others.
- The state is always derived from the local reviewer's **most recent verdict**, never from its most recent *clean* verdict. Selection happens first, classification second.
- When that most recent verdict is clean, it is classified by its commit's ancestry relationship to the commit the external reviewer reviewed — same, ancestor, descendant, or unrelated — and the four are recorded as distinct states that are never merged. Only same and ancestor count. A descendant clean means the local reviewer cleared newer code than the external reviewer looked at, and an unrelated clean means a force-push severed the relationship; neither is evidence that the local reviewer saw what was found.
- A local reviewer that is **configured but has not yet produced a verdict** is recorded distinctly from one that is **not configured at all**. The first describes a pull request early in its life, the second a repository that will never produce local evidence, and summing them would make the two indistinguishable in the numbers.
- Only **blocking** external findings qualify. Advisory or suggestion-level findings do not create a record, because the local reviewer is not expected to surface them and counting them would inflate the miss rate.
- The **local** reviewer's own findings never create a missed-finding record. The record exists to compare an external reviewer against the local one; a reviewer cannot miss its own findings.
- Records accumulate; they are never overwritten or de-duplicated. Two external rounds finding the same thing on the same commit are two records, because the loop genuinely ran twice.
- No missed-finding record changes any review outcome, readiness label, tracker status, or merge decision. This feature only observes.
- Every record is attributable to a specific commit. A record that cannot name the commit the external reviewer reviewed is not written, and the loop reports why rather than writing an unattributable record.

## Statuses / Enum Values

The **local evidence state** recorded on each external round that reports
blocking findings.

**One verdict is selected, then classified.** The state is derived from the
local reviewer's **most recent verdict** on the pull request — not from its most
recent *clean* verdict. If that most recent verdict is clean, its commit's
ancestry relationship to the one the external reviewer reviewed selects among
the four clean states. If it is anything else, that verdict's own outcome
selects the state, and no earlier clean verdict is consulted. A local reviewer
that cleared one commit and then reported findings on a later one is
`not_clean`; reaching past that to the earlier clean verdict would count a round
as missed on a verdict the reviewer itself had already superseded.

The list is closed: any situation not described by a row is recorded as
`unknown`.

| Code value | Display label | Description | Counts as missed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clean_same_commit` | Clean, same commit | The local reviewer reported clean on the exact commit the external reviewer reviewed. | **Yes — confirmed miss** |
| `clean_earlier_commit` | Clean, earlier commit | The local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean, on an ancestor of the commit the external reviewer reviewed. | No — **possible miss** |
| `clean_later_commit` | Clean, later commit | The local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean, on a descendant of the commit the external reviewer reviewed — it cleared newer code than the external reviewer looked at. | No |
| `clean_unrelated_commit` | Clean, unrelated commit | The local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean, on a commit with no ancestry relationship to the one the external reviewer reviewed, which a force-push can produce. | No |
| `not_clean` | Reported findings | The local reviewer's most recent verdict reported findings of its own. | No |
| `skipped` | Skipped | The local reviewer was configured and deliberately skipped this round. | No |
| `unavailable` | Unavailable | The local reviewer was configured but could not run — a timeout, an outage, or a credentials failure. | No |
| `not_yet_run` | Not yet run | The local reviewer is configured and has not yet produced any verdict on this pull request. | No |
| `not_configured` | Not configured | The local reviewer is not configured for this repository, so it will never run. | No |
| `unknown` | Unknown | The history is readable but does not establish the local reviewer's most recent verdict. | No |

**Exactly one of the ten states is a confirmed miss: `clean_same_commit`.**
Only there did the local reviewer demonstrably look at the very code the
external reviewer found something in.

`clean_earlier_commit` is recorded as a **possible miss** and is reported
separately. It is not counted as a confirmed miss, because a clean verdict on an
ancestor does not establish that the local reviewer saw the defect: the code the
external reviewer flagged may have arrived in a commit after the one the local
reviewer cleared. Counting it would inflate the numerator on evidence that does
not support the claim, which is the failure this spec exists to avoid. It is
still recorded distinctly rather than discarded, because the brief asks for the
same-head-or-ancestor distinction and a separate possible-miss count is a useful
weaker signal for the effectiveness report.

Every other state, including `unknown` and any situation this table does not
describe, is neither a confirmed nor a possible miss.

`clean_later_commit` and `clean_unrelated_commit` are separated from
`clean_earlier_commit` deliberately. A clean verdict on newer or unrelated code
is not evidence that the local reviewer looked at what the external reviewer
found, so counting it would attribute a miss to a reviewer that never saw the
code. `not_yet_run` is separated from `not_configured` for the same reason the
spec separates `unavailable` from `not_clean`: "has not run yet" and "will never
run" describe different repositories and must not be summed.

**Valid transitions**: none. The state is decided once, when the record is
written, and describes the evidence at that moment. It is never revised — a
later local run does not rewrite an earlier record, because the record is a
historical observation rather than a current status.

## Decision Matrix

The complete gate, from an external reviewer returning a result to a record
existing or not. Rows are evaluated in order and the first match decides.

| # | External result | Commit attributable | History writable | Local evidence state | Record written | Miss classification | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Reported by the local reviewer itself | — | — | — | No | Neither | Nothing; a reviewer cannot miss its own findings |
| 2 | No blocking findings — clean, skipped, or advisory only | — | — | — | No | Neither | Nothing; only blocking external findings qualify |
| 3 | Blocking findings | **No** | — | — | No | Neither | Report why the commit could not be established; write no unattributable record |
| 4 | Blocking findings | Yes | **No** | — | No | Neither | Report that telemetry could not be recorded, and why; leave the existing history untouched and attempt no reconstruction |
| 5 | Blocking findings | Yes | Yes | `clean_same_commit` | Yes | **Confirmed miss** | Show in the summary; include in the confirmed-miss count |
| 6 | Blocking findings | Yes | Yes | `clean_earlier_commit` | Yes | **Possible miss** | Show in the summary; include in the possible-miss count, never in the confirmed count |
| 7 | Blocking findings | Yes | Yes | Any other state in the Statuses table | Yes | Neither | Show in the summary; include in the denominator only |
| 8 | Blocking findings | Yes | Yes | Not describable by any row of the Statuses table | Yes, as `unknown` | Neither | Show in the summary; include in the denominator only |

Rows 5 through 8 are the reason a record is written on every qualifying external
round rather than only on confirmed misses: rows 7 and 8 are the denominator,
and a rate needs both halves.

The ordering matters. History writability is checked at row 4 — **after**
eligibility and commit attribution, not before. A round that was never going to
produce a record, because the findings came from the local reviewer or were
advisory, must not report a telemetry failure just because the history happens
to be unwritable; nothing was owed. Row 4 is also distinct from row 8: row 8
records `unknown` because the history is healthy and silent about the local
verdict, whereas row 4 cannot record anything because the history is the thing
that failed.

## Operational Visibility

- **Reviewer-loop summary**: each missed-finding record appears as one line in the pull request's reviewer-loop summary, naming the external reviewer, the commit, the finding count, and the local evidence state.
- **Reviewer-loop history**: the full structured record is written into the history the loop already maintains on the pull request, in the same place and with the same lifecycle as the entries already there.
- **Audit trail**: no separate audit surface is introduced. The pull request is the record, deliberately — telemetry stored somewhere a reviewer never looks does not get checked against reality.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-1.** When an external reviewer reports blocking findings on a commit for which the local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean on that same commit, the reviewer-loop history gains a record naming that reviewer, that commit, the number of blocking findings, the files they touch, and the local evidence state `clean_same_commit`, **and that record is a confirmed miss**.
- [ ] **AC-2.** When the local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean and on an ancestor of the commit the external reviewer reviewed, the record's local evidence state is `clean_earlier_commit`, it is distinguishable from `clean_same_commit` without inspecting commits by hand, **and it is a possible miss — counted separately and never included in the confirmed-miss count**.
- [ ] **AC-3.** When the local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean and on a descendant of the commit the external reviewer reviewed, the state is `clean_later_commit` and it is neither a confirmed nor a possible miss.
- [ ] **AC-4.** When the local reviewer's most recent verdict was clean and on a commit with no ancestry relationship to the one the external reviewer reviewed, the state is `clean_unrelated_commit` and it is neither a confirmed nor a possible miss.
- [ ] **AC-4a.** When the local reviewer cleared one commit and then reported findings on a later commit, the state is `not_clean` and is neither a confirmed nor a possible miss, even though an earlier clean verdict on an ancestor exists. The most recent verdict is the only one consulted.
- [ ] **AC-5.** When the local reviewer's most recent verdict reported findings, the record is still written and its local evidence state is `not_clean`, and it is neither a confirmed nor a possible miss.
- [ ] **AC-6.** When the local reviewer was skipped, was unavailable, is configured but has not yet produced a verdict, or is not configured at all, the record is written with the corresponding state, the four are distinguishable from one another and from `not_clean`, **and none of the four is a confirmed or a possible miss**.
- [ ] **AC-7.** When the history is readable but does not establish the local reviewer's most recent verdict, the record is written with state `unknown` and is neither a confirmed nor a possible miss.
- [ ] **AC-7a.** When an external reviewer has reported blocking findings on an establishable commit **and** the reviewer-loop history cannot be read, parsed, or appended to, no missed-finding record is written, the existing history is left byte-for-byte unchanged, and the round's output states that telemetry could not be recorded and why.
- [ ] **AC-7b.** When no record was owed in the first place — the findings came from the local reviewer, or were advisory only, or the reviewed commit could not be established — an unwritable history produces **no** telemetry-failure report, because nothing was owed.
- [ ] **AC-8.** Advisory or suggestion-level external findings produce no missed-finding record.
- [ ] **AC-9.** Findings reported by the local reviewer itself produce no missed-finding record.
- [ ] **AC-10.** Two qualifying external rounds on the same pull request produce two records; neither replaces the other.
- [ ] **AC-11.** When the commit an external reviewer reviewed cannot be established, no record is written and the loop reports the reason.
- [ ] **AC-12.** A pull request carrying missed-finding records reaches exactly the same review outcome, readiness label, and tracker status it would reach without them.
- [ ] **AC-13.** Each record adds exactly one line to the reviewer-loop summary, and that line is at most 200 characters.
- [ ] **AC-14.** A record's summary line names **at most three** file paths and **always states the total number of files** the findings touch. When the findings touch more than the number of paths named, the line says how many more there are.
- [ ] **AC-14a.** The 200-character bound in AC-13 takes precedence over the path count in AC-14. When naming three paths would exceed it, the line names as many as fit — down to none — and the total file count is still stated. A line that reaches the bound with zero paths named is a valid line, not a failure.
- [ ] **AC-15.** A pull request carrying twenty records adds at most twenty lines and 4,000 characters to the reviewer-loop summary, whatever the number of findings or the length of their paths.
- [ ] **AC-16.** The records for a pull request can be read back in full by a later report without re-running any reviewer.
- [ ] **AC-17.** Exactly one of the ten local evidence states is a confirmed miss (`clean_same_commit`) and exactly one is a possible miss (`clean_earlier_commit`). A record in any of the other eight states, including `unknown`, is neither, while remaining present in the history.
- [ ] **AC-17a.** A report reading these records can produce the confirmed-miss count and the possible-miss count separately, and no operation folds the second into the first.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- **Reporting or aggregating across pull requests.** This feature produces the per-pull-request record; turning it into an effectiveness report, per pull request or across a window, is item #1657. Deferral note: the brief's "support later effectiveness reporting" objective is met here by producing a readable, complete record, not by producing the report itself. No human confirmation requested — the split follows the epic's own decomposition.
- **Attributing a miss to a cause.** The record says the local reviewer cleared a commit on which an external reviewer later found something. It does not say why — whether the finding was outside the local reviewer's checklist, beyond its context window, or a genuine oversight. Deferral note: cause attribution needs the doctrine work in #1654 to have landed first, and guessing at causes would pollute the measurement this item exists to make trustworthy. No human confirmation requested.
- **Acting on the records.** Nothing in this feature changes a gate, a threshold, or a reviewer's configuration in response to what is recorded. Deferral note: measurement first, response second; a control loop built on unvalidated telemetry is worse than none. No human confirmation requested.
- **Recording near-misses.** An external reviewer that reports advisory findings after a local clean verdict is not recorded. Deferral note: the brief scopes this to blockers, and advisory findings are not something the local reviewer is expected to surface. No human confirmation requested.
