## Summary

**Approach**: The reviewer loop already writes one `reviewer_loop_history.v1`
entry per iteration, carrying the head commit, the platforms that ran, and the
blocking count. What it does not record is the comparison the spec asks for:
when an external reviewer reports blocking findings, what the **local**
reviewer's most recent verdict was, and on which commit.

This plan adds a `missed_findings` array to each history entry — one element per
external platform that reported blocking findings in that round — carrying the
reviewer, the reviewed commit, the finding count, **every** distinct file the
findings touch with the total, and the local evidence state. The three-path
limit belongs to the rendered summary line, never to the stored record: the
record is what a later report reads, and a report cannot recover a path that was
discarded at write time. It adds the derivation that produces that
state: select the local reviewer's most recent verdict first, classify it
second, and when the verdict is clean, decide the ancestry relationship between
its commit and the reviewed one.

**Two properties do the work, and both are about not overclaiming.** The
numerator is narrow: only `clean_same_commit` is a confirmed miss, and the
ancestor case is recorded separately as a possible miss. The denominator is
wide: a record is written on **every** qualifying external round, including the
ones that are not misses at all, because a rate needs both halves and a
telemetry that records only its numerator can only report 100%.

**Estimated complexity**: M

**Rationale**: The write path is an addition to a builder that already exists,
and the render path is one line per record. What makes it more than small is the
derivation. It reads history the loop wrote earlier, orders verdicts by
recency rather than by outcome, and asks git a question — *is this commit an
ancestor of that one* — that has four possible answers plus a fifth,
undecidable one that a naive implementation silently folds into one of the
four. Every one of those confusions inflates or deflates a number that this
feature exists to make trustworthy.

**Dependencies**: **#1648 must be implemented and merged to
`develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` before this item's implementation PR
opens.** The derivation needs to know which commit each reviewer's verdict
describes, per reviewer; that per-reviewer head evidence is what #1648
introduces. #1648's plan is merged and its implementation is not, so this is a
sequencing constraint on implementation only — the two plan PRs are independent.

## Verification Log

| Check | Command / query | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo revision | `git rev-parse --short origin/develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` | `903de533` |
| The history entry builder and its shape | `sed -n '6876,6950p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `reviewer_loop_history_build_entry` produces a flat object of eighteen fields plus one nested object, `phase_after_clean`. The nested object is the precedent this plan follows: a related group of values belongs in one sub-object rather than as five sibling keys |
| The entry carries no per-platform outcome | Same range | `result` is the **aggregate** loop result for the round and `platforms` is a list of names. A round where the local reviewer was clean and an external one reported findings records `needs_fixes` and nothing that separates them, so the local verdict cannot be recovered from a stored entry. #1648 adds per-reviewer *heads*, not per-reviewer *outcomes* — hence `platform_results` in this plan |
| The raw per-platform outcome exists in memory but is not persisted | `sed -n '8624,8630p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `platform_result` and `platform_reason` are read straight from the companion script's `RESULT` and `REASON` keys — the machine-readable pair. `platform_results` is that pair written to the ledger, not a new derivation |
| The display array is **not** a usable source | `sed -n '8652,8674p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `platform_result_tokens[]` is built after the raw pair for the summary comment: it applies a platform-supplied `DISPLAY_RESULT` override, renders `escalate` as `escalated (<reason>)`, and folds `skipped/unavailable` and `skipped/not_configured` into one word. Two spec states are unreachable from it and escalations are unparseable |
| The configured platform list has a source | `grep -n "workflow_config_review_platforms" scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Produced at line 8339. It is the only thing that distinguishes `not_configured` from `not_yet_run`, since both look identical in an empty history |
| Writability is already a decided state — and today it **destroys** the history | `sed -n '6960,7030p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `append_safe`, `history_status` and `history_unavailable_reason` already exist. On malformed history, unknown schema, or a prior unavailable payload the loop builds a **replacement** payload with `entries: []` and renders it over the previous block. The spec's row 4 is this branch, but AC-7a's byte-for-byte preservation is **not** current behavior and needs the change described in Layer-by-Layer |
| The reason vocabulary that already exists | Same range, plus `grep -n 'unavailable_reason=' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | **Four** values: `malformed_history`, `unknown_schema`, `missing_history_json` (line 6992 — the marker is present but its JSON block is absent), and a pass-through `prior_unavailable`. Row 4's "report why" is satisfied by surfacing these, not by adding new ones |
| Blocking paths are already extracted per platform | `sed -n '6786,6800p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | `reviewer_loop_blocking_paths_from_output` reads `BLOCKING_<n>_PATH` from a platform's output. The record's path list and total come from here; nothing new parses reviewer output |
| The dispatcher's platform list | `sed -n '/^run_platform_review()/,/^}/p' scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh` | Eleven platforms, ten of them external: `greptile`, `devin`, `coderabbit`, `coderabbit-cli`, `pr-agent`, `codex-github`, `claude-code-action`, `copilot`, `haystack`, `bugbot`. The adapter table in Layer-by-Layer covers all ten; none is omitted and none is invented |
| Review comments carry the commit they were written against | `gh api repos/lhpaul/ai-dev-framework-template/pulls/1663/comments --jq '.[0] \| {user, commit_id}'` | Returns `commit_id` `613bc33b…` for a `cursor[bot]` comment — the reviewer's own statement of which commit its finding is attached to. This is the evidence the external adapters emit as `REVIEWED_HEAD`; nothing is inferred from what the loop dispatched |
| Check runs carry theirs | `gh api repos/lhpaul/ai-dev-framework-template/commits/2c37d0ba/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[0] \| {name, head_sha}'` | Returns `head_sha` `2c37d0ba…`. Platforms that post a check rather than comments have the same evidence under a different field |
| Ancestry has a precedent in this repository | `grep -rn "merge-base --is-ancestor" scripts/development-workflow/` | Two call sites — `validate-branch-reuse.sh:408` and `prepare-release-post-merge-cleanup.sh:532` — both using `git merge-base --is-ancestor A B` with output discarded and the **exit status** read. This plan uses the same form and, unlike both, distinguishes the third exit status |
| The local reviewer's platform name is a fixed string | `grep -n "local-ai-reviewer" .ai-dev-workflow.yaml` | The platform is named `local-ai-reviewer` in configuration, and the loop reports it under that name. The record's "is this the local reviewer" test compares against that name |

**What this log does not establish.** It does not establish that misses are
common, or that the local reviewer is or is not effective. That is the question
the feature exists to make answerable, and answering it before building the
measurement would be assuming the conclusion.

## Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check

### Applicable

| Assumption surface | Recorded value | Authoritative source | Verified at | Bounded cross-check scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approved base branch for this item | `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness` | `integration-branch:internal-reviewer-effectiveness` label on #1651 | 2026-08-28, repo SHA `903de533` | Epic #1647 items | `Verified` |
| Per-reviewer head evidence exists | Introduced by #1648 | #1648's implementation plan, merged | 2026-08-28, repo SHA `903de533` | #1648 and #1651 | `Conflict` — see below |

**Conflict record.** The derivation needs each reviewer's reviewed commit, and
that evidence does not exist on the base branch: #1648's plan is merged, its
implementation is not. Affected plan statements: the whole derivation and every
scenario that exercises it.

**Resolution status**: `Resolved` by sequencing. Recorded in **Dependencies**
and enforced by **Implementation Order step 0**, a hard stop before any code
change. Decision owner: LH — if #1648 is implemented differently from its plan,
this plan must be revised rather than adapted during implementation.

### Not applicable

**Overall result for this check**: `Applicable` — the three rows above are the
assumption surfaces and the implementer must re-verify each at implementation
start. This subsection scopes only surfaces carrying no assumption.

**Surfaces with no assumption**: no database, no runtime service, no
user-facing surface, no scheduled job, no external API, no deployment target.

## Layer-by-Layer Changes

### Database / Data Layer

Not applicable.

### Backend / API

Not applicable — this repository ships workflow tooling, not a service.

### Shared Packages / Libraries

- [ ] **Persist per-platform verdicts in the ledger entry.** The entry records
      `result` — the **aggregate** loop result for the round — and `platforms`,
      a list of names with no outcomes. Neither says what the *local* reviewer
      concluded, so a round in which the local reviewer was clean and an
      external one reported findings has `result: "needs_fixes"` and nothing to
      distinguish the two. The derivation below cannot be built on that, and
      AC-4a cannot be satisfied by it. #1648 supplies each reviewer's reviewed
      **head**; it does not supply each reviewer's **outcome**.

      Add `platform_results` to the entry, built at the per-platform call site
      from the **raw** values `platform_result` and `platform_reason`
      (`pr-review-loop.sh:8624` and `:8629`), which are read straight from the
      companion script's `RESULT` and `REASON` keys.

      **Not from `platform_result_tokens`.** That array is built twelve lines
      later for the summary comment and is *display* text: it applies a
      `DISPLAY_RESULT` override supplied by the platform, renders `escalate` as
      `escalated (<reason>)`, and folds `skipped` with reason `unavailable` or
      `not_configured` into the single word `unavailable`. Parsing it back into
      an outcome would mean re-deriving a value that was already discarded, and
      would return `unknown` for every escalation and every override. Collect a
      parallel `platform_result_records` array of compact JSON objects at the
      same call site instead:

      ```text
      "platform_results": [
        {"platform": "local-ai-reviewer", "result": "clean",
         "raw_result": "clean",   "raw_reason": ""},
        {"platform": "codex-github",      "result": "unavailable",
         "raw_result": "skipped", "raw_reason": "unavailable"}
      ]
      ```

      **`result` is the normalized outcome; `raw_result` and `raw_reason` are
      what the companion script said.** Normalization happens **once**, here at
      collection time, and every later reader — the selector, the state
      derivation, a future report — reads `result` and never re-derives it. The
      raw pair is kept beside it because a normalization that discards its input
      cannot be audited when a reader disagrees with it.

      `reason` is carried because two spec states are distinguished by it and
      by nothing else.

      **`platform_results` carries no head, because #1648 already persists
      one.** #1648's plan adds `reviewed_heads[]` to the entry — one entry per
      platform, populated from `kv_value_default REVIEWED_HEAD` in the same
      per-platform block, with the empty string for reviewers that report none
      — plus `classification_head`, the snapshot those states were computed
      against. Storing the head a second time inside `platform_results` would
      create two persisted copies of one fact with no rule for what to do when
      they disagree.

      So this plan **joins** rather than duplicates: `platform_results` holds
      the outcome fields, `reviewed_heads[]` holds the heads, and the two are
      matched on the platform name. #1648 defines each element of that array
      with the keys `platform`, `reviewed_head`, `state` and `reason`, so the
      join reads `.reviewed_head` — the field names come from #1648's plan and
      must be re-read there at implementation time, since a wrong key here
      yields an empty head, an undecidable ancestry, and `unknown` on every
      round. The derivation reads the head for a platform
      from `reviewed_heads[]` and nowhere else. Where #1648's field records the
      empty string, the reviewed commit **cannot be established**, and the spec
      is unambiguous: AC-11 and Decision Matrix row 3 require no record and a
      reported reason.

      **What this item still owns is the adapter work.** #1648 reads whatever
      each platform emits and renders a non-reporting reviewer as
      `not-reported`; it does not make any platform start reporting. Today only
      `local-ai-reviewer` does, so `reviewed_heads[]` would be empty for every
      external platform and no external round could be attributed. Extending the
      adapters is therefore this plan's, and it fills #1648's field rather than
      creating a parallel one.

      **Each external adapter emits `REVIEWED_HEAD` from its own artifact.**
      Only `local-ai-reviewer` does today, and an earlier revision of this plan
      deferred the rest to a follow-up item — which would have left every
      external round rejected at the attribution gate and made AC-1 through
      AC-7, AC-10 and AC-13 through AC-17a unreachable in operation. A feature
      whose acceptance criteria cannot be exercised is not shipped, so the
      adapters are in scope here.

      The evidence exists and it is the reviewer's own, not the loop's:

      | Platform artifact | Field | Command |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | A pull-request review comment | `commit_id` — the commit the finding is attached to | `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<n>/comments` |
      | A check run | `head_sha` — the commit the run executed against | `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/commits/<sha>/check-runs` |

      Each adapter reads the artifact it already consumes to decide its result,
      takes that commit, and emits it as `REVIEWED_HEAD`. Nothing is inferred
      from what the loop dispatched.

      **Adapter by adapter.** `run_platform_review` dispatches eleven platforms;
      ten are external. Line numbers are at `903de533`, and the *artifact*
      column records what each adapter already fetches — the implementer must
      re-read each function and confirm the field before writing the extraction,
      because this table is a starting map and not a substitute for looking:

      Each adapter emits `REVIEWED_HEAD` in its `key=value` output, which
      #1648's collection already reads; nothing here writes to
      `reviewed_heads[]` directly.

      | Adapter | Function line | Artifact it already consumes | Head field |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | `greptile` | 774 | review comments and issue comments | `commit_id` on the review comment |
      | `codex-github` | 1050 | reviews and issue comments | `commit_id` on the review |
      | `claude-code-action` | 1228 | issue comments from a bot login | **none** — issue comments carry no commit; see below |
      | `copilot` | 1352 | `pulls/<n>/reviews/<id>/comments` | `commit_id` on the review comment |
      | `bugbot` | 1794 | review comments and reviews | `commit_id` |
      | `haystack` | 2540 | a local companion script | `haystack-reviewer.sh:202` already resolves `head.sha` and fetches the check run **for that commit**; the script emits that value |
      | `coderabbit-cli` | 2711 | a local companion script | `coderabbit-cli-reviewer.sh:186-194` already resolves `HEAD_SHA` from `headRefOid` and requires the checkout to match it; the script emits that value |
      | `devin` | 2970 | review comments and reviews | `commit_id` |
      | `pr-agent` | 3418 | an issue comment; its check-run query only detects an active run | **none** — see below |
      | `coderabbit` | 4979 | review comments and reviews | `commit_id` |

      **Issue comments carry no commit, and that is the load-bearing row.**
      GitHub attaches a commit to *review* comments and to *reviews*, not to
      issue comments — so an adapter whose only artifact is an issue comment has
      no evidence, emits no head, and its rounds produce no record. **Two**
      adapters are in that position, `claude-code-action` and `pr-agent`.

      `pr-agent` looks like it escapes because it also touches a check run, and
      it does not. `run_pr_agent_review` locates that run **by the pull
      request's current head**, and uses it only to detect whether a run is
      active; the result it reports comes from an issue comment. Taking the
      run's `head_sha` would therefore be circular — the loop would look up a
      commit it already chose and call it the reviewer's statement — and it
      could attribute a finding to a commit the comment never established.
      An earlier revision of this plan did exactly that. It is withdrawn:
      `pr-agent` emits no head until it names a commit in its own output.

      Neither is a defect to work around. It is the attribution rule applying to
      a platform that never says what it read, and inventing a head for it is
      the failure the rule exists to prevent.

      **The two local companion scripts already hold the evidence**, which is
      why "as `local-ai-reviewer.sh` does" is a statement about output format
      and not an assumption about availability:

      - `coderabbit-cli-reviewer.sh:186-194` resolves `HEAD_SHA` from the pull
        request's `headRefOid`, and `--repo-root` requires the checkout's HEAD
        to match it before the CLI runs. The commit it reviewed is therefore
        the commit it already holds.
      - `haystack-reviewer.sh:198-207` resolves `head.sha` and then fetches the
        check runs **for that commit**, so the finding it reports is attached to
        a commit it named.

      Both are extended to print that value as `REVIEWED_HEAD` in their existing
      `key=value` output — a new line, not a new derivation. If either check
      returns no head, the script prints none and the round produces no record,
      which is the same AC-11 path as any other platform. Scenario 13f covers
      both, and the implementer must confirm the two line references before
      writing the change, as with every other row of the table.

      **Two rules keep the evidence honest**, and both fail closed to AC-11's
      no-record path:

      1. If the artifacts a platform produced for this round name **more than
         one** commit, no head is emitted. A reviewer whose findings straddle
         two commits did not review one commit, and picking either would be a
         guess wearing evidence's clothes.
      2. If a platform produced no artifact carrying a commit — a bare status,
         a summary comment with no `commit_id` — no head is emitted.

      An earlier revision substituted `loop_head_sha`, the head the loop
      *dispatched* against, in both cases. It is withdrawn: the dispatched head
      is what the loop sent, not what the reviewer read, and
      `clean_same_commit` is defined against the commit the external reviewer
      *reviewed*.


      The normalization applied at collection time:

      | `result` | `reason` | Outcome recorded |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `clean` | — | `clean` |
      | `needs_fixes` | — | `needs_fixes` |
      | `skipped` | `unavailable` | `unavailable` |
      | `skipped` | `not_configured` | `not_configured` |
      | `skipped` | anything else | `skipped` |
      | `escalate` | — | `unavailable` — a reviewer that could not complete |
      | anything else | — | `unknown` |

      `skipped` splits three ways on `reason` alone, which is why the reason is
      stored rather than dropped: a reviewer that was deliberately skipped and
      one that timed out both arrive as `RESULT=skipped`, and the spec keeps
      them apart.

      **One reconciliation happens later, and only one.** Collection cannot see
      the configured-platform list, so a round reporting
      `skipped/not_configured` normalizes to `not_configured` here and the
      selector — which does have the list — upgrades it. That is the single
      exception to "normalize once", and it exists because the two values answer
      different questions and only the selector holds both.

      **When the round says `skipped/not_configured` but the configured list
      contains the reviewer, the state is `unavailable`, not `not_configured`.**
      The two sources answer different questions and only one of them is about
      the repository: the list says the reviewer *is* configured, so
      `not_configured` — whose spec meaning is that it will never run — would
      be false. What actually happened is that a configured reviewer did not
      run this round, which is precisely `unavailable`. The reverse
      disagreement cannot arise: the list is consulted first, and a reviewer
      absent from it returns `not_configured` before any round is examined.
      Scenario 2a pins the disagreement.

      **Entries written before this change carry no `platform_results`, and
      those entries yield `unknown` — never the aggregate `result`.** Reading
      the aggregate as if it were the local reviewer's verdict is exactly the
      confusion this field exists to end, and a back-compatibility path that
      reintroduces it would put wrong values into the historical half of the
      data, where nobody would look for them. Fail-closed, and scenario 3a pins
      it.

- [ ] **Select the local reviewer's most recent verdict.** Add
      `reviewer_loop_local_latest_verdict <history_payload> <configured_platforms>`,
      returning one compact JSON object:
      `{"outcome":…,"head_sha":…,"iteration":…}`.

      **Two inputs, because two different questions are being asked.** The
      payload answers *what did the local reviewer most recently conclude*; the
      configured-platform list answers *is it configured at all*, which no
      amount of history can establish — an empty history looks identical for a
      repository that has not run the reviewer yet and one that never will. The
      list is the value `workflow_config_review_platforms` already produces at
      `pr-review-loop.sh:8339`, passed in rather than re-read, so the function
      stays testable without a configuration file. It is **newline-delimited,
      one platform per line** — the loop reads it with a
      `while IFS= read -r line` loop at lines 8336-8339 — and membership is
      tested with `grep -Fxq` fed from a **here-string**, a whole-line literal
      comparison with no pipeline. `printf | grep -q` would be the obvious
      spelling and is wrong here: `grep -q` closes its input on the first match,
      so under `set -o pipefail` a long list lets the producer take SIGPIPE and
      the failed pipeline reports a configured reviewer as `not_configured`. A comma-split
      would match only when the reviewer is the single configured platform, and
      a substring test would accept a platform named `local-ai-reviewer-v2`;
      both report the wrong state in the direction that says a configured
      reviewer will never run.

      It scans `entries[]` in **descending iteration order** and returns the
      first entry whose `platform_results` names the local reviewer, taking
      **that platform's** normalized `result` — never the entry's aggregate
      `result`, and never re-deriving the outcome from `raw_result` and
      `raw_reason`, which are there for audit rather than for reading. Its only
      transformation is the single reconciliation above: `not_configured`
      becomes `unavailable` when the configured list contains the reviewer.

      **The current round is part of that scan, and it is the case AC-1 is
      about.** A local reviewer that reports clean and an external reviewer that
      reports blocking findings **in the same round** is the confirmed miss the
      whole feature exists to record, and at the moment the records are built
      the round's verdicts live only in the freshly collected
      `platform_result_records` — the entry that will carry them has not been
      written yet. A selector reading persisted entries alone would classify
      that round from the *previous* round's verdict, or from nothing at all,
      and would report `unknown` or a stale state on the single most important
      case.

      So the caller composes before it selects: the current round's records are
      appended to `entries[]` as a synthetic entry carrying the current
      iteration number, and the composed value is what the selector receives.

      **The synthetic entry must carry `reviewed_heads[]` too, not only
      `platform_results`.** The selector reads the outcome from one and the
      commit from the other, joined on platform name, so an entry with results
      and no heads yields an empty head, an undecidable ancestry and `unknown` —
      on precisely the same-round case this composition exists to serve. Both
      arrays are built from the same per-platform block and are available at the
      same moment; composing one without the other is the kind of half-move that
      passes a test written against the field it did include.
      The composition happens at the call site rather than inside the selector,
      so the function stays a pure query over one payload and the tests can
      supply either shape. Scenarios 1a and 1b pin both halves — the current
      round winning over a prior one, and the current round being used when
      there is no prior one at all. Selection by recency, then
      classification — never "the most recent clean verdict", which is the same
      sentence with the search order and the filter swapped, and which AC-4a
      exists to forbid: a reviewer that cleared one commit and then reported
      findings on a later one is `not_clean`, and reaching past that to the
      earlier clean verdict would count a round as missed on a verdict the
      reviewer itself superseded.

      Three results are not verdicts and are returned as such, because the spec
      separates them and summing them would make different repositories look
      alike:

      | Situation | Returned outcome | Why it is distinct |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | The local reviewer is **not** in the configured platform list | `not_configured` | a repository that will never produce local evidence — checked **first**, because an unconfigured reviewer with an empty history must not read as `not_yet_run` |
      | It is configured and the history has **no entries at all** | `not_yet_run` | a pull request early in its life |
      | It is configured, entries **exist**, but none names it in `platform_results` — including every entry written before this change | `unknown` | the history is healthy and silent |

      The last two rows are separated by whether `entries` is empty, not by
      whether the search found anything. Both searches come back empty-handed,
      and collapsing them would report `not_yet_run` for a pull request with
      forty rounds of history that happens to say nothing about the local
      reviewer — which is AC-7's `unknown`, not "has not run yet".

- [ ] **Classify a clean verdict by ancestry.** Add
      `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry <clean_head> <reviewed_head>`, printing
      exactly one of `same`, `ancestor`, `descendant`, `unrelated`,
      `undecidable`.

      ```text
      clean_head == reviewed_head                        → same
      git merge-base --is-ancestor clean reviewed  → 0   → ancestor
      git merge-base --is-ancestor reviewed clean  → 0   → descendant
      both return 1                                      → unrelated
      either returns anything else, or a commit is absent → undecidable
      ```

      **Every one of those statuses must be captured with `|| status=$?`, not
      read from a bare call.** `pr-review-loop.sh` runs under `set -euo
      pipefail`, and status 1 — "not an ancestor", the answer this function
      exists to read — would terminate the shell before the status could be
      examined. A command in a `||` list is exempt from errexit; a standalone
      one is not. The failure is not subtle in effect: `ancestor`,
      `descendant` and `unrelated` would all be unreachable, so every clean
      verdict on a different commit would abort the round rather than be
      classified.

      **`undecidable` is the state a naive implementation loses**, and losing it
      is not cosmetic. `git merge-base --is-ancestor` exits 0 for yes, **1 for
      no, and something else for an error** — a missing object after a
      force-push, a corrupt repository, a shallow clone whose history does not
      reach far enough. Treating "not 0" as "no" turns every one of those into
      `unrelated`, which is a *decided* answer meaning a force-push severed the
      relationship. The record would then assert something the repository never
      established. Both existing call sites in this repository — the two named
      in the Verification Log — read only zero versus non-zero, which is safe
      for their yes/no questions and would be wrong here.

      An `undecidable` result maps to the local evidence state **`unknown`**,
      which the spec's Statuses table defines as the closed list's catch-all:
      *any situation not described by a row*. A clean verdict whose ancestry
      cannot be computed is exactly that. It is neither a confirmed nor a
      possible miss, and it is still recorded, so it lands in the denominator
      where it belongs.

      The function also verifies both commits **exist locally** before asking,
      with `git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}`; an absent commit is `undecidable`
      rather than an error, because a reviewer loop must not fail a pull request
      over telemetry.

- [ ] **Derive the local evidence state.** Add
      `reviewer_loop_local_evidence_state <local_verdict_json> <reviewed_head>`,
      printing one of the spec's ten values. It is a pure mapping over the two
      previous functions and holds no logic of its own beyond the table:

      Its input is the **normalized** outcome the selector returns — the value
      collection already produced — so the rows are keyed on those seven values
      and never on the companion script's raw ones. Keying a row on `escalate`
      or `timeout` would be keying it on something the selector never emits:
      collection maps both to `unavailable`, that row would never match, and the
      verdict would fall through to `unknown` — losing exactly the distinction
      AC-6 requires between an outage and missing evidence.

      | Normalized outcome | Ancestry | State |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `clean` | `same` | `clean_same_commit` |
      | `clean` | `ancestor` | `clean_earlier_commit` |
      | `clean` | `descendant` | `clean_later_commit` |
      | `clean` | `unrelated` | `clean_unrelated_commit` |
      | `clean` | `undecidable` | `unknown` |
      | `needs_fixes` | — | `not_clean` |
      | `skipped` | — | `skipped` |
      | `unavailable` | — | `unavailable` |
      | `not_yet_run` | — | `not_yet_run` |
      | `not_configured` | — | `not_configured` |
      | anything else | — | `unknown` |

      The `unavailable` row is an identity, which looks redundant and is not:
      the normalization that produced it happened at collection, in a different
      function, and this table is what says the state survives the trip.

      Eleven rows over ten states: `unknown` is reached two ways, from an
      undecidable ancestry and from an unrecognised outcome, and the plan keeps
      them as separate rows rather than one so that neither is added by
      accident later.

- [ ] **Build the records.** Add
      `reviewer_loop_missed_finding_records`, returning a JSON array with one
      object per **external** platform that reported blocking findings this
      round. It takes **no** head argument: each platform's head is joined from
      `reviewed_heads[]` on that platform's own name, inside the per-platform
      loop. A single `<reviewed_head>` parameter — which an earlier revision of
      this plan had — cannot represent a round in which two platforms reviewed
      different commits, and that is not a corner case: reviewers are dispatched
      at different moments and a push between them gives them different heads.
      One would then be attributed to the other's commit, and a
      `clean_same_commit` could follow from it.

      ```text
      {
        "reviewer": "codex-github",
        "reviewed_head": "<40-hex, joined from #1648's reviewed_heads[]>",
        "blocking_count": 7,
        "paths": ["a.ts", "b.ts", "c.ts", "…all twelve, de-duplicated…"],
        "path_total": 12,
        "_paths_is": "every distinct file, in first-appearance order",
        "_path_total_is": "distinct files, not findings",
        "local_evidence_state": "clean_same_commit",
        "classification": "confirmed_miss"   # see the three-value enum below
      }
      ```

      **The record stores every distinct path; only the summary line is
      limited to three.** The spec's three-path bound is AC-14, which governs
      the *line*; AC-1 asks the record to capture the files the findings touch
      and AC-16 requires the record to be readable in full later without
      re-running a reviewer. A record holding three of twelve paths would
      satisfy neither: the other nine would be unrecoverable, and a report
      asking *which files do external reviewers find things in* — the question
      #1657 exists to answer — could not be answered from the history at all.

      So truncation happens **at render time and nowhere else**. The record
      holds the complete de-duplicated list in first-appearance order; the
      renderer takes as many as fit.

      **`path_total` counts distinct paths, not findings.**
      `reviewer_loop_blocking_paths_from_output` emits one line per finding, so
      three blockers in one file yield that path three times. AC-14 asks for the
      total number of *files*, so the list is de-duplicated — preserving first
      appearance order — before both the total and the three named paths are
      taken. Without it a record claiming "12 files" on a pull request touching
      four would overstate the blast radius of every finding, and the named
      paths could be three copies of one file. Scenario 13a pins it.

      Four exclusions, each from a spec rule and each an early `continue`
      rather than a filter on the finished array, so a record that must not
      exist is never built:

      1. the platform **is** the local reviewer — a reviewer cannot miss its
         own findings;
      2. the platform reported no **blocking** findings — advisory findings do
         not qualify;
      3. the platform emitted no `REVIEWED_HEAD` — its artifacts named no
         commit, or named more than one. The reviewed commit cannot be
         established, so no record and a reported reason. There is **no**
         fallback: `loop_head_sha` is not substituted;
      4. the round is not eligible at all, which rows 1 and 2 of the spec's
         matrix already cover.

      **`classification` has exactly three values**, and the mapping is total
      over the spec's ten states:

      | Local evidence state | `classification` |
      | --- | --- |
      | `clean_same_commit` | `confirmed_miss` |
      | `clean_earlier_commit` | `possible_miss` |
      | the other eight, including `unknown` | `not_a_miss` |

      Three values rather than two plus an absent field: a record with no
      `classification` key is indistinguishable from one written before the
      field existed, and `not_a_miss` is a positive statement that the round was
      recorded and judged. AC-17 fixes the first two rows as one state each;
      the third is everything else, so the mapping cannot gain a fourth value
      without changing the spec.

      `classification` is written into the record rather than left for a reader
      to re-derive from the state. AC-17a requires the two counts to be
      separable by a later report, and a reader that re-derives it needs its own
      copy of the confirmed/possible mapping — which is the second copy of a
      rule, and the one that drifts.

- [ ] **Write the array into the entry.** Extend
      `reviewer_loop_history_build_entry` with `missed_findings`, defaulting to
      `[]`. Follow the convention the function already uses for
      `unresolved_thread_count` and `current_run_id`: read from a caller-set
      global rather than adding a nineteenth positional parameter.

      **The schema string stays `reviewer_loop_history.v1`.** The change is
      purely additive, every existing field keeps its name, type and meaning,
      and readers that ignore the new key are unaffected. A bump would break a
      reader that validates the string exactly, for no gain. Scenario 14
      asserts field-by-field that the eighteen existing fields and
      `phase_after_clean` are unchanged.

- [ ] **Preserve the existing history when it cannot be appended to, and report
      the failure.** AC-7a requires the existing history to be left
      byte-for-byte unchanged, and **that is not what the code does today**.
      When `append_safe` is 0, `reviewer_loop_history_payload_from_existing`
      builds a replacement payload with `entries: []` and
      `history_status: "unavailable"`, and the render path writes it over the
      previously posted block — so a history that merely failed to parse this
      once is replaced by an empty stub, and the entries it held are gone from
      the pull request.

      The change, therefore, is a real one and not a report bolted onto
      existing behavior:

      1. When `append_safe` is 0, **do not re-render the history section at
         all.** Leave the previously posted block exactly as it stands,
         including a malformed one — a block that failed to parse is the
         evidence of the failure, and overwriting it destroys the only copy.
      2. Report the failure in the summary body instead, naming the reason the
         loop already computed. The vocabulary is **four** values, not three,
         and the list is taken from the code rather than remembered:
         `malformed_history`, `unknown_schema`, `missing_history_json`
         (`pr-review-loop.sh:6992` — the marker is present but its JSON block
         is absent), and the passed-through `prior_unavailable`. No new reason
         is introduced. An earlier revision of this plan listed three and
         omitted `missing_history_json`, which is the one produced by a comment
         someone edited by hand — the likeliest of the four in practice.
      3. Keep `reviewer_loop_history_unavailable_stub_body` for the case it is
         genuinely for — a pull request with **no** prior history block at all,
         where there is nothing to preserve and the stub is the first thing
         written.

      Scenario 11 asserts the byte-for-byte preservation against the prior
      body, and proof **P7** plants the current stub-replacement behavior.

      **And only when something was owed.** AC-7b requires no telemetry-failure
      report when no record was due — the findings came from the local reviewer,
      or were advisory, or the commit could not be established. The eligibility
      test therefore runs **before** the writability test, matching the spec's
      row ordering, and the plan states the order because the natural
      implementation is the other way round: writability is a property of the
      loop and eligibility is a property of the round, so a programmer checks
      the cheap global first and reports a failure nobody was waiting for.

### Frontend / UI

- [ ] **Render one line per record in the reviewer-loop summary**, at most 200
      characters:

      ```text
      missed-finding: codex-github on 6780c658 — 7 blocking, 12 files (a.ts, b.ts, c.ts, +9 more) — local: Clean, same commit [confirmed_miss]
      ```

      **`+9 more` is required, not decoration.** AC-14 asks the line to say how
      many further files there are whenever the findings touch more than the
      paths named, and the remainder is `path_total` minus the number actually
      named — which is not always three, because the bound can stop the list
      earlier. A line naming zero paths therefore reads `12 files (+12 more)`,
      and a line naming all of them omits the remainder entirely rather than
      printing `+0 more`.

      **The bound is enforced by reservation, not by writing order and not by
      truncating the finished line.** The paths sit in the middle of the line,
      as the sample shows, so "write the state first" would not protect it —
      what protects it is that the path list is the only variable-length part
      and it is given a budget rather than a position:

      1. `prefix` = `missed-finding: <reviewer> on <short-sha> — <n> blocking,
         <total> files (`
      2. `suffix` = `) — local: <state label> [<classification>]`, where
         `<state label>` is the spec's **Display label** for the state
         (`Clean, same commit`) and `<classification>` is the **stored enum
         value** verbatim (`confirmed_miss`) — not a prettified form of it. Two
         different renderings of one field is how a length calculation and a
         sample drift apart, and the enum is what a reader greps for.
      3. `remainder_max` = the length of `, +<path_total> more`, the longest
         remainder text this record can produce.
      4. `budget` = 200 − length(`prefix`) − length(`suffix`) − `remainder_max`.
      5. Append paths one at a time while the next still fits the budget; stop
         at the first that does not.
      6. Compute the actual remainder from the paths **named**; omit it
         entirely when it is zero.

      Reserving `remainder_max` up front is the step a naive implementation
      skips: appending paths until full and *then* adding `, +9 more` overflows
      the bound by exactly the text that says something was omitted. Reserving
      the maximum rather than the actual value is deliberate — the actual
      remainder is not known until the list stops, and a budget that depends on
      the answer cannot be used to compute it.

      A line that names **zero** paths is valid — AC-14a says so explicitly —
      and is what a pull request with very long paths produces.

      **`budget` can never go negative, and the proof is arithmetic rather than
      a promise.** AC-13 admits no exception, so an over-length escape hatch
      would be a plan contradicting its own spec. Every field of `prefix` and
      `suffix` is bounded:

      | Field | Bound | Source of the bound |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Literal text of both parts | 56 | `prefix` 42 — `missed-finding: ` 16, ` on ` 4, ` — ` 3, ` blocking, ` 11, ` files (` 8 — plus `suffix` 14: `) — local: ` 11, ` [` 2, `]` 1 |
      | Reviewer name | 18 | the longest of the eleven names `run_platform_review` dispatches, `claude-code-action` |
      | Short SHA | 8 | fixed rendering |
      | Blocking count, path total | their own decimal width, **exact** | AC-14 requires the total and the omitted count to be exact, so neither is clamped or abbreviated |
      | State label **and** classification, jointly | 34 | the largest **reachable** pair — see below |

      The label and the classification are bounded **together**, not
      separately, because the classification is a function of the state and
      most pairings cannot occur. Taking each field's own maximum would bound a
      record that does not exist:

      | Reachable pair | Length |
      | --- | --- |
      | `Clean, earlier commit` + `possible_miss` | 21 + 13 = **34** |
      | `Clean, unrelated commit` + `not_a_miss` | 23 + 10 = 33 |
      | `Clean, same commit` + `confirmed_miss` | 18 + 14 = 32 |

      The longest label carries the *shortest* classification, so the true
      worst case is the middle row, not the pairing of the two field maxima.

      The counts are the only fields without a fixed width, and the budget is
      computed from their **actual** rendered length rather than a reserved
      guess — over-reserving drops a path that fits, under-reserving overflows
      the line. Nothing is clamped: AC-14 requires the total and the omitted
      count to be exact.

      The fixed parts total **116** characters: literals 56, reviewer 18, short
      SHA 8, label and classification 34. The remainder text `, +<total> more`
      contributes 8 literal characters plus its own copy of the total's digits.
      What remains for the two counts and at least zero paths is:

      ```text
      116 + blocking_digits + total_digits + 8 + total_digits ≤ 200
      ⇒ blocking_digits + 2 × total_digits ≤ 76
      ```

      A pull request with 9,999,999 findings across 9,999,999 files spends 21
      of those 76. Exhausting the budget needs a **35-digit** file count, which
      is not a number a diff can produce and not one the ledger's JSON could
      hold as an exact integer. So `budget ≥ 0` holds for every reachable
      record with nothing abbreviated, and AC-13 and AC-14 hold together.
      Scenario 13c-ii asserts the worst realistic line and the exact rendering.

      AC-15 follows from the same bound: twenty records at 200 characters is
      exactly 4,000.

## Testing Strategy

**Test types**: Unit (shell harness), plus the smoke test runbook.

**Key scenarios to test**:

1a. The **current round** supplies the verdict when it has one, with the
    synthetic entry carrying **both** `platform_results` and `reviewed_heads[]`
    — both pinned in the fixture, since omitting the heads yields `unknown`
    while every assertion about the outcome still passes: a round in which
    the local reviewer reported clean and an external reviewer reported blocking
    findings yields `clean_same_commit` and a confirmed miss — not a state
    derived from the previous round. This is AC-1's case and the one the feature
    exists for.
1b. The current round supplies the verdict when there is **no** prior entry at
    all, rather than falling back to `not_yet_run`.
1. `reviewer_loop_local_latest_verdict` returns the **most recent** verdict, not
   the most recent clean one: a history with a clean local verdict at iteration
   2 and a `needs_fixes` local verdict at iteration 5 returns the iteration-5
   verdict. This is AC-4a, and it is the single most likely implementation
   error in the item.
2c. Membership survives a **long** configured list: a list of 500 platforms
    with `local-ai-reviewer` as the **first** entry is recognised. The early
    match is what makes `grep -q` close its input, and the length is what makes
    the producer still be writing when it does; either alone leaves the SIGPIPE
    path unexercised.
2b. Membership is by **whole line**: a configured list of three platforms with
    `local-ai-reviewer` among them is recognised, one where it is the sole entry
    is recognised, one containing only `local-ai-reviewer-v2` is **not**, and an
    empty list is not. The first case fails under a comma-split test and the
    third under a substring test, so both wrong implementations are excluded by
    the same scenario.
2a. The two sources of `not_configured` disagreeing: a round recorded as
    `skipped` with reason `not_configured` while the configured list **contains**
    the reviewer yields `unavailable`, never `not_configured`. The list says the
    reviewer will run; the round says it did not; "will never run" is false.
2. It returns `not_yet_run` when the local reviewer is configured and the
   history has **no entries at all**, and `not_configured` when it is absent
   from the configured list — **with the same empty history in both calls**, so
   the only thing that differs is the configured-platform argument. The two are
   asserted to be different values, not merely both non-clean.
3. It returns `unknown` when **entries exist** but none names the local
   reviewer — distinguished from scenario 2's `not_yet_run` by the presence of
   entries alone, since both searches come back empty-handed.
3a. It returns `unknown` for an entry written **before** this change — one with
    `platforms` but no `platform_results` — even when that entry's aggregate
    `result` is `clean`. Reading the aggregate as the local verdict is the
    confusion `platform_results` exists to end, and a back-compatibility path
    that reintroduced it would put wrong values into the historical half of the
    data.
3b. The verdict comes from the **local reviewer's** entry in
    `platform_results`, not the aggregate: an entry whose aggregate `result` is
    `needs_fixes` because an external reviewer failed, while the local
    reviewer's own result is `clean`, yields `clean`.
4. `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry` returns each of `same`, `ancestor`,
   `descendant` and `unrelated` against a purpose-built fixture repository with
   two branches and a common root.
5. It returns `undecidable` in three cases, each needing its **own** fixture
   because the function's own ordering makes them unreachable from one another:

   | Case | Fixture | Why the other fixtures cannot reach it |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | A commit absent from the repository | an object created then removed with `git prune` | — |
   | A `--is-ancestor` exit status other than 0 or 1 | a **`git` stub** first on `PATH` that forwards every subcommand to the real binary **except** `merge-base --is-ancestor`, for which it exits 128 | the deleted-object fixture is intercepted by the preceding `git cat-file -e`, so `merge-base` never runs and the >1 branch is never entered |
   | An empty commit argument | the empty string | — |

   Asserted as `undecidable` specifically, never as `unrelated`.
5b. **Two identical but missing SHAs** — the same 40-character string, naming no
    object in the repository — return `undecidable`, not `same`. A shortcut that
    compares before checking existence produces `clean_same_commit` and a
    confirmed miss from a commit nobody has, and it is the one input where the
    two obvious orderings disagree.
5a. Every branch runs under `set -euo pipefail` without terminating the shell,
    exercised by sourcing the loop with `HARNESS_MODE=1` — which is how the
    script itself runs — and calling the function for each of the five results.
    The `ancestor`, `descendant` and `unrelated` cases all pass through an exit
    status of 1, which a bare call would turn into an aborted round rather than
    a classification.
6. `reviewer_loop_local_evidence_state` produces each of the ten states, one
   case per row of its eleven-row table, including both routes to `unknown`.
   Every case supplies a **normalized** outcome, since that is what the selector
   returns; a case built from a raw `escalate` would exercise the fall-through
   row rather than the `unavailable` one.
6b. **Normalization, one case per row of the collection table** — seven: `clean`;
    `needs_fixes`; `skipped` with reason `unavailable`; `skipped` with reason
    `not_configured`; `skipped` with any other reason; `escalate`; and an
    unrecognised result. Each asserts the stored `result` **and** that
    `raw_result` and `raw_reason` retain what the companion script emitted.
    These run against the collection step, not the selector, because
    normalization happens once at collection and the selector only reads it.
6a. A **local** verdict whose `reviewed_heads[]` entry is empty yields
    `unknown`, not a
    state derived from the entry's `head_sha`. The entry's head is the live head
    at write time — what the pull request pointed at when the row was written —
    and using it would compare the external reviewer's commit against a commit
    the local reviewer may never have examined, producing `clean_same_commit`
    from two unrelated facts.
7. A record is **not** built for the local reviewer's own blocking findings.
8. A record is **not** built for an external platform whose findings are
   advisory only.
9. A record **is** built for an external platform with blocking findings whose
   local evidence state is `not_clean` — the denominator case. A record that
   only appeared for misses is the failure this scenario guards.
10. Two qualifying rounds produce two records; the second does not replace the
    first, and no de-duplication occurs even when reviewer, commit and finding
    count are identical.
11a. Each of the four unavailable reasons — `malformed_history`,
    `unknown_schema`, `missing_history_json` and `prior_unavailable` — is named
    in the telemetry-failure report, one case per reason.
11. With `append_safe` at 0 and a prior history block present, no record is
    written, the prior block is **byte-for-byte unchanged** — asserted against a
    saved copy of the prior body, not against a re-render — and the summary body
    names the reason. A separate case with **no** prior block writes the
    unavailable stub, which is what the stub is for.
12. With `append_safe` at 0 **and** no record owed, the output contains **no**
    telemetry-failure report. AC-7b, and the scenario that fails if the two
    tests are ordered the other way. **Three** cases, because the spec's matrix
    has three ineligible rows and they are excluded at different points:
    findings from the local reviewer (row 1), advisory-only findings (row 2),
    and **external blocking findings whose commit cannot be established**
    (row 3).
12a. The third case is the one that separates two plausible orderings. An
    implementation that tests writability *after* finding blockers but *before*
    attributing the commit passes cases 1 and 2 — both are excluded before any
    head is consulted — and reports a telemetry failure on case 3, where AC-7b
    says nothing was owed. Writability is tested **last**, after all three
    eligibility rows.
13. The summary line: one line per record; at most 200 characters; at most three
    paths; the total always stated; and a zero-path case whose path length is
    **derived from the budget**, not chosen. With the fixed parts at 116 and a
    12-file record's counts and remainder taking 13 — `7` at one digit, `12` at
    two, and the remainder's 8 literals plus two more digits — the budget is
    about 71 characters, so a single 90-character path cannot fit and no path
    is named.
    A "longer than 60 characters" fixture names one and proves nothing.
13a. Paths are de-duplicated before counting and naming: eight blocking findings
    spread over three files produce `path_total` 3, not 8, and the named paths
    are three **distinct** files rather than repeats of one.
13a-i. The **record** holds all twelve paths of a twelve-file round while its
    summary line names three. Read the record back and confirm every path is
    present — the assertion that separates storage from rendering, and the one
    that fails if an implementer applies the line's bound to the record.
13c-ii. The worst realistic line fits and its counts are **exact**: the
    longest reviewer name (`claude-code-action`), the longest reachable
    label-and-classification pair (`Clean, earlier commit` with
    `possible_miss`, 34 characters — longer than the longest label paired with
    its own classification), and both counts at 9,999,999. It renders at most
    200 characters with both counts in full — seven digits each, never
    abbreviated — and at least one path named. The budget must be computed from
    the counts' actual width: a fixed reservation drops a path that would have
    fit. Pairing `Clean, unrelated commit` with
    `confirmed_miss` would be a shorter line *and* an impossible record, since
    AC-17 makes `clean_same_commit` the only confirmed miss.
13c-i. The bound is met by **reservation**: a record whose paths would fit
    exactly 200 characters *without* the remainder text still leaves room for
    it, so the emitted line is at most 200 with `, +N more` included. Appending
    until full and adding the remainder afterwards overflows by precisely the
    text announcing the omission, and only a fixture sized to the boundary
    catches it.
13c-iii. The rendered line uses the spec's display label for the state and the
    **stored enum value** for the classification, asserted against an exact
    expected string — `— local: Clean, same commit [confirmed_miss]` — so a
    prettified `[confirmed miss]` fails. The length arithmetic counts the enum,
    so a rendering that differs from it silently invalidates the bound.
13c. The remainder is stated and is correct at every truncation point: a record
    naming three of twelve files reads `+9 more`; the zero-path line of
    scenario 13 reads `+12 more`; and a record whose files all fit omits the
    remainder rather than printing `+0 more`.
13d. Attribution comes only from the reviewer's own `REVIEWED_HEAD`: a platform
    that emits one produces a record; a platform that emits nothing produces
    **no** record and an attribution-failure report, even though `loop_head_sha`
    is available and would have been a plausible substitute. Asserted with
    `loop_head_sha` present in the environment, so the scenario fails if an
    implementer reaches for it.
13e. Each external adapter emits `REVIEWED_HEAD` from its own artifact, and
    fails closed: one case where the round's review comments all carry the same
    `commit_id` — a head is emitted; one where they carry **two different**
    `commit_id` values — **no** head; one where the platform produced only a
    check run — its `head_sha` is emitted; and one where the platform produced a
    comment with no `commit_id` at all — no head.
13f. One case **per adapter** from the adapter table — ten — asserting the head
    each emits from a fixture of its own artifact shape. **Eight** emit one;
    `claude-code-action` and `pr-agent` emit **none**, because an issue comment
    carries no commit and `pr-agent`'s check run is located by the head the loop
    already chose. Written per adapter rather than as one generic case: the four
    artifact shapes are not interchangeable, and the row most likely to be
    implemented wrong is the one whose correct answer is "no head".
13b. An external round whose reviewed commit **cannot be established** produces
    no record, and the round's output states the attribution failure and its
    reason. This is AC-11, and it is the third of the spec's three no-record
    cases — the other two, local-reviewer findings and advisory-only findings,
    are scenarios 7 and 8. Without it the only tested no-record paths would be
    the two that never reach attribution.
14. The history entry retains all eighteen existing fields, the
    `phase_after_clean` object, and #1648's `reviewed_heads[]` and
    `classification_head`, unchanged in name and type, and adds exactly two:
    `platform_results` and `missed_findings`. Asserted against an enumerated
    list, not a count.
14a. `platform_results` carries **no** head field, and every head the derivation
    uses comes from `reviewed_heads[]` matched on platform name, read from that
    element's `reviewed_head` key. The fixture uses #1648's element shape —
    `platform`, `reviewed_head`, `state`, `reason` — so a lookup on the wrong
    key fails the scenario rather than silently returning null. Two persisted
    copies of one fact is the defect; asserting the absence is what stops the
    second copy being reintroduced by an implementer who finds the join
    inconvenient.
15. Twenty records add at most twenty lines and 4,000 characters, with paths
    chosen to be long — AC-15, which is only meaningful when the fixture tries
    to break it.
16. A record carries `classification` directly, and the confirmed and possible
    counts are separable by reading records alone, with no reader-side mapping
    from state to classification.
16a. The state-to-classification mapping is exercised **once per state** — ten
    cases: `clean_same_commit` → `confirmed_miss`, `clean_earlier_commit` →
    `possible_miss`, and the remaining eight → `not_a_miss`. Every record
    carries the key; none omits it.
16b. A round in which **two** external platforms report blocking findings on
    **different** commits produces two records, each carrying its own
    reviewer's head from `reviewed_heads[]`. A builder taking one head for the
    round attributes both records to one commit, and a `clean_same_commit` can
    follow from the wrong one.

## Seed Data

| Fixture | Contents | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verdict-order history | A `reviewer_loop_history.v1` payload with a clean local verdict at iteration 2 and a `needs_fixes` local verdict at iteration 5 | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Absent-reviewer histories | One payload where the local reviewer appears in no entry, and one where it is absent from the configured platform list | inline in the same file |
| Ancestry repository | A temporary git repository: a root commit, a branch of two commits, a second branch of two commits from the same root, and one commit created then deleted with `git prune` to produce the absent-object case | created and torn down by `test-reviewer-loop-commit-ancestry.sh` |
| `git` stub for the error-status case | A shell script named `git`, first on `PATH`, that `exec`s the real binary for every invocation **except** `merge-base --is-ancestor`, where it exits 128. Both commits exist, so `git cat-file -e` succeeds and execution reaches the branch under test | created and torn down by the same suite; the real `git` is resolved once, before the stub is installed, so the forward cannot recurse |
| Long-path record | A twelve-file record whose paths are each **90 characters** — derived from the budget: fixed parts 116, this record's counts and remainder 13, leaving about 71, so no path fits | inline in `scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-pr-review-loop.sh` |
| Twenty-record entry | Twenty records with long paths and large finding counts, for AC-15 | inline in the same file |

## Documentation Updates

- `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`
  — the `missed_findings` array, the ten states, and the summary line format.
- The `--help` block of `pr-review-loop.sh`, where the ledger is described.
- No `REVIEW.md` change: this item adds telemetry, not a review rule.
- `changelog.d/1651.added.missed-finding-telemetry.md` — the release-note
  fragment Protocol 03 Step 6 requires of feature work. `<kind>` is `added`
  rather than `changed`: the reviewer-loop history gains a record type that did
  not exist, and no existing behavior changes for anyone not reading it. The
  body is written from the reader's perspective — what a pull request now
  records and what it does not claim — rather than as a description of the
  code.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ancestry errors are folded into `unrelated` | **High** — it is what both existing call sites do | **High** — the record asserts a force-push severed the relationship when the repository simply could not answer, and the number is wrong in a way nobody can see | `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry` returns five values, not four; only exit status 1 from both directions is `unrelated`; anything else is `undecidable`, which maps to `unknown`. Scenario 5 covers three routes to it and proof **P3** plants the fold |
| The derivation reaches for the most recent **clean** verdict | **High** — it is the more natural sentence, and it reads as more helpful | **High** — a reviewer that cleared one commit and then reported findings on a later one would be recorded as having missed something it had already caught | Selection is by recency and classification is second, stated in that order in the plan and in the function's name. Scenario 1 and proof **P1** |
| Records are written only for misses | Med | **High** — the denominator becomes unknowable and the reported rate is always 100% | A record is written on every qualifying external round, including `not_clean` and `unknown`. Scenario 9 and proof **P2** |
| A telemetry failure is reported when nothing was owed | Med | Low — noise on pull requests where the feature had nothing to do, which erodes trust in the signal | The eligibility test runs before the writability test, matching the spec's row order. Scenario 12 and proof **P5** |
| A `grep -q` membership check is fed by a pipeline under `set -o pipefail` | **High** — `printf \| grep -q` is the obvious spelling | **High** — a configured reviewer is reported `not_configured` on any list long enough for the producer to still be writing, removing every round on that repository from the denominator | A here-string, so no pipeline status exists. Scenario 2c uses an early match in a 500-entry list, and proof **P22** restores the pipeline |
| A `git` exit status of 1 is read from a bare call under `set -e` | **High** — it is the shorter and more obvious way to write it | **High** — three of the five results become unreachable and the round aborts instead of classifying | Every status is captured with `\|\| status=$?`, which is exempt from errexit. Scenario 5a and proof **P9** |
| The summary line's bound is enforced by truncating the finished string | Med | Med — truncation removes the tail, which is where the state and the classification sit | The renderer reserves the lengths of the prefix, the suffix and the longest possible remainder **before** appending any path, then stops at the first path that would exceed what remains — so the state and the classification, which follow the paths in the line, cannot be the text the bound removes. Scenarios 13, 13c-i and 13c-ii, and proofs **P6**, **P23** and **P24** |
| The additive fields break a ledger reader | Low | Med | The schema string is unchanged and every existing field keeps its name and type; scenario 14 asserts them individually |
| External reviewers report no head, so the feature collects nothing | **High** if the adapters are left alone | **High** — every acceptance criterion becomes unreachable in operation and the telemetry is empty while looking like "no misses" | The adapters are extended in this item to emit `REVIEWED_HEAD` from their own artifacts — a review comment's `commit_id` or a check run's `head_sha`. Not from `loop_head_sha`, which the spec forbids. Scenarios 13d and 13e; proof **P15** plants the dispatch substitution |
| An adapter's artifacts name two commits and one is picked | Med — a slow reviewer posting across a push | **High** — the record would name a commit the finding does not belong to, and a confirmed miss would follow from it | Multiple commits means no head and no record, fail-closed to AC-11. Scenario 13e and proof **P17** |
| An empty telemetry is read as "no misses" | Low, once the adapters report | Med — a report over zero records looks like a clean bill of health | The attribution-failure report fires whenever a head cannot be established, so "nothing was recorded and here is why" is on the pull request. #1657 must distinguish *no misses* from *no records*, which is noted as an input to that item rather than left for it to discover |
| The current round's verdict is not composed in before selection | **High** — the selector's input is naturally the persisted payload | **High** — the confirmed-miss case in AC-1 is exactly a same-round local clean, so the feature would miss the thing it exists to record while passing every other test | The call site composes the round's `platform_result_records` as a synthetic entry before selecting. Scenarios 1a and 1b, proof **P14** |
| A pre-change entry's aggregate result is read as the local reviewer's verdict | **High** — it is the only outcome those entries carry | **High** — rounds the local reviewer never ran become confirmed misses, in the historical half of the data where nobody checks | Entries without `platform_results` yield `unknown`, never the aggregate. Scenario 3a and proof **P8** |
| An unappendable history is replaced by an empty stub | **High** — it is the current behavior | **High** — every entry the pull request held is lost, and the stub looks like a well-formed report rather than a deletion | The render path leaves the prior block untouched; the stub is written only when there is no prior block. Scenario 11 and proof **P7** |

## Code Samples

The two functions the whole feature's honesty rests on:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

```bash
# Five answers, not four. `git merge-base --is-ancestor` exits 0 for yes,
# 1 for no, and other for error; folding "other" into "no" would record
# `unrelated` — a decided answer — for a question the repository could not
# answer at all.
reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry() {
  local clean="${1:-}" reviewed="${2:-}" status

  [ -n "$clean" ] && [ -n "$reviewed" ] || { printf 'undecidable\n'; return 0; }

  # Existence is checked BEFORE the equality shortcut. Two identical SHAs that
  # name no object in this repository are not "the same commit" — they are two
  # copies of a commit nobody has. Shortcutting on equality first would return
  # `same`, and a `clean_same_commit` confirmed miss would follow from a commit
  # that does not exist: the strongest claim this feature can make, resting on
  # the weakest evidence it can have.
  git cat-file -e "${clean}^{commit}" 2>/dev/null || { printf 'undecidable\n'; return 0; }
  git cat-file -e "${reviewed}^{commit}" 2>/dev/null || { printf 'undecidable\n'; return 0; }

  [ "$clean" = "$reviewed" ] && { printf 'same\n'; return 0; }

  # `|| status=$?` and not a bare call: the script runs under `set -e`, and the
  # expected status 1 — "not an ancestor", the answer this function exists to
  # read — would terminate the shell before the next line. A command in a `||`
  # list is exempt from errexit; a standalone one is not.
  status=0
  git merge-base --is-ancestor "$clean" "$reviewed" >/dev/null 2>&1 || status=$?
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ] && { printf 'ancestor\n'; return 0; }

  printf 'unrelated\n'
}

# Recency first, outcome second. Never "the most recent clean verdict", and
# never the entry's aggregate `.result` — that is the round's outcome, not the
# local reviewer's. Entries with no platform_results yield unknown.
reviewer_loop_local_latest_verdict() {

  # `while IFS= read -r line` loop), so a comma-delimited `case` would match
  # only when the reviewer is the sole entry — and would report a configured
  # repository as `not_configured`, the state that means "will never run".
  # `grep -Fxq` compares whole lines and takes the pattern literally, so a
  # platform named `local-ai-reviewer-v2` cannot satisfy it either.
  # A here-string, not `printf | grep -q`: the script runs under
  # `set -o pipefail` and `grep -q` closes its input on the first match, so the
  # producer can take SIGPIPE on a long list and the failed pipeline would
  # report a configured reviewer as `not_configured`. Same hazard, same fix, as
  # the changed-files decode in #1653.

## Planted-Violation Proofs

`REVIEW.md` → Core Rules → Verification Discipline requires two demonstrated
runs per proof, each citing a concrete file and line. The thirty proofs fall into
three groups:

| Group | Count | Proofs | What the plant reproduces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overclaiming | **17** | P1, P2, P3, P4, P8, P10, P12, P14, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19, P21, P22, P25, P28 |
| Under-recording | **1** | P20 | evidence discarded at write time that cannot be recovered later | a number asserted on evidence that does not support it |
| Contract | **12** | P5, P6, P7, P9, P11, P13, P23, P24, P26, P27, P29, P30 | a report, a line, or a stored history that breaks its own stated contract |

| # | Violation to plant | Where | Check that must fail, then pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Select the most recent **clean** local verdict instead of the most recent verdict | a scratch copy of `reviewer_loop_local_latest_verdict` | scenario 1 fails: a reviewer that cleared iteration 2 and reported findings at iteration 5 is recorded as `clean_earlier_commit` — a possible miss — on a verdict it had already superseded. The confirmed and possible counts both rise on evidence the reviewer itself withdrew; restoring recency-first selection passes |
| P2 | Write records only when the state is a confirmed or possible miss | a scratch copy of the record builder | scenario 9 fails: the denominator disappears, and every report built on these records reads 100% missed. This is the failure that makes the whole feature worse than nothing, because it produces a confident wrong number rather than no number; restoring the every-qualifying-round rule passes |
| P9 | Read `--is-ancestor` with a bare call instead of `\|\| status=$?` | a scratch copy of `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry` | scenario 5a fails: under `set -e` the expected status 1 terminates the shell, so `ancestor`, `descendant` and `unrelated` become unreachable and every clean verdict on a different commit aborts the round instead of being classified. Scenario 4's `same` case still passes, because it returns before any `git` call; restoring the `\|\| status=$?` capture passes all five |
| P10 | Return `not_yet_run` whenever the local-reviewer search finds nothing | a scratch copy of the selector | scenario 3 fails: a pull request with forty rounds of history that says nothing about the local reviewer is reported as "has not run yet", so a repository whose local reviewer silently stopped appearing looks like a young pull request forever; restoring the empty-entries test passes |
| P3 | Treat any non-zero `--is-ancestor` status as "not an ancestor" | a scratch copy of `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry` | scenario 5's **stub** case fails — it is the only one that reaches the `merge-base` call with both commits present, which is why the stub exists and the deleted-object fixture cannot substitute for it. Of scenario 5's three cases: an absent commit, a non-0/1 exit, and an empty argument are all recorded as `clean_unrelated_commit`, asserting a severed relationship the repository never established. Scenario 4 still passes, which is the point — the plant is invisible to every test with a healthy repository; restoring the five-way return passes |
| P4 | Merge `not_yet_run` into `not_configured` | a scratch copy of the verdict selector | scenario 2 fails: a pull request early in its life and a repository with no local reviewer become the same value, and the report can no longer tell "has not run yet" from "will never run"; restoring the two values passes |
| P5 | Test writability before eligibility | a scratch copy of the record entry point | scenario 12 fails: a round whose only findings came from the local reviewer reports a telemetry failure on an unwritable history, though no record was owed. Scenario 11 still passes; restoring the spec's row order passes both |
| P7 | Keep the current behavior: re-render the history section with the unavailable stub when `append_safe` is 0 | a scratch copy of the render path | scenario 11 fails: the prior block is replaced by an empty stub, so a history that failed to parse once loses every entry it held — and the loss is invisible, because the stub looks like a well-formed report of a problem; restoring the do-not-re-render rule passes |
| P8 | Fall back to the entry's aggregate `result` when `platform_results` is absent | a scratch copy of the selector | scenario 3a fails: a pre-change entry whose round was aggregate-clean is read as a clean **local** verdict, so rounds the local reviewer never ran are recorded as confirmed misses. The plant only affects historical entries, which is where nobody looks; restoring the `unknown` fallback passes |
| P11 | Build `platform_results` from `platform_result_tokens` instead of the raw pair | a scratch copy of the collection step | scenario 6b fails on four of its seven rows: `escalate` becomes the unparseable `escalated (<reason>)`, a `DISPLAY_RESULT` override becomes whatever the platform chose, and both `skipped` reasons collapse into `unavailable` — so `skipped` and `not_configured` become unreachable and escalations record as `unknown`. `raw_result` and `raw_reason` cannot be recovered at all. Restoring the raw pair passes all seven |
| P12 | Count `path_total` without de-duplicating | a scratch copy of the record builder | scenario 13a fails: eight findings across three files report **eight** files rather than three, and the named paths become repeats of one file — overstating the blast radius of every record and wasting the line's three path slots; restoring the de-duplication passes |
| P13 | Compute the remainder as `path_total - 3` instead of from the paths actually named | a scratch copy of the renderer | scenario 13c fails at every truncation point: the zero-path line reads `+9 more` for twelve files, and a record with two files fitting reads `-1 more`. The plant is invisible whenever exactly three paths fit, which is the common case; restoring the count-what-was-named rule passes |
| P14 | Select from persisted entries only, omitting the current round's records | a scratch copy of the call site | scenarios 1a and 1b fail: a round where the local reviewer was clean and an external reviewer found blockers is classified from the previous round's verdict, or as `not_yet_run` when there is no previous round — so the confirmed miss the feature exists to record is the one case it cannot see. Every other scenario still passes, because they all supply the verdict as prior history; restoring the composition passes |
| P16 | Fall back to the entry's `head_sha` when a local verdict has no `reviewed_head` | a scratch copy of the selector | scenario 6a fails: the local reviewer's verdict is compared against the live head at write time rather than the commit it examined, so two unrelated facts can produce `clean_same_commit` and a confirmed miss. The plant is invisible whenever the two happen to coincide, which is most rounds; restoring the empty head — and with it an undecidable ancestry and `unknown` — passes |
| P19 | Test configured-platform membership with a comma-delimited `case` | a scratch copy of the selector's guard | scenario 2b's first case fails: a repository configuring three platforms, `local-ai-reviewer` among them, is reported `not_configured` — the state meaning the reviewer will never run — so every round on it is excluded from the denominator and the effectiveness rate is computed over the wrong population. The plant passes whenever the reviewer is the only configured platform, which is the shape every single-platform fixture has; restoring `grep -Fxq` passes |
| P18 | Give `claude-code-action` or `pr-agent` a head from the pull request's current head — directly, or via the check run `run_pr_agent_review` locates with it | a scratch copy of either adapter | scenario 13f's two no-head cases fail: an adapter whose only artifact is an issue comment gains a head it never stated, and its rounds start producing records — and confirmed misses — against a commit nobody claimed to have reviewed. The `pr-agent` half is the subtler plant, because the head arrives through a real artifact and still originates from the loop's own choice; restoring the no-head result passes |
| P22 | Feed the membership check with `printf '%s\\n' "$configured" \| grep -Fxq` | a scratch copy of the guard | scenario 2c fails under `set -o pipefail`: `grep -q` closes its input on the first match, the producer takes SIGPIPE on the remaining 499 lines, the pipeline reports non-zero, and a configured reviewer is classified `not_configured` — removing every round on that repository from the denominator. Scenario 2b still passes on its short lists, which is why 2c specifies both the early match and the length; restoring the here-string passes |
| P21 | Compose the current round's `platform_results` without its `reviewed_heads[]` | a scratch copy of the call site | scenarios 1a and 1b fail: the same-round local-clean verdict is found, its head is empty, the ancestry is undecidable and the state is `unknown` — so the confirmed miss this feature exists to record becomes an unknown, and the half-move looks correct because the outcome half of the composition works; restoring both arrays passes |
| P30 | Render the classification with spaces (`confirmed miss`) instead of the stored enum | a scratch copy of the renderer | scenario 13c-iii fails against its exact expected string. The length arithmetic counts the enum's width, so a different rendering makes the 200-character proof describe a line the code does not produce — and the drift is invisible on short records, which is every other scenario; restoring the enum passes |
| P29 | Test history writability after the blocking check but before commit attribution | a scratch copy of the record entry point | scenario 12's third case fails: an external round whose commit cannot be established reports a telemetry failure though AC-7b says nothing was owed. Cases 1 and 2 pass, because the local-reviewer and advisory exclusions both fire before any head is consulted — so the ordering defect is invisible to two of the three ineligible rows; restoring the writability-last order passes all three |
| P28 | Return `same` on string equality before checking that either commit exists | a scratch copy of `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry` | scenario 5b fails: two identical SHAs naming no object return `same`, so a confirmed miss is recorded against a commit the repository does not have. Scenario 4's healthy cases and scenario 5's mismatched-missing cases both still pass — equality and existence only disagree when the *same* absent SHA appears on both sides; restoring the existence-first order passes |
| P25 | Take one `reviewed_head` for the whole round instead of joining per platform | a scratch copy of the record builder | scenario 16b fails: two platforms that reviewed different commits are both attributed to one, so one record names a commit its reviewer never read and a `clean_same_commit` can follow from it. Every single-platform scenario passes, which is all of the others; restoring the per-platform join passes |
| P27 | Key the evidence-state rows on the raw outcomes `escalate` and `timeout` instead of the normalized `unavailable` | a scratch copy of the mapping | scenario 6's `unavailable` case fails: nothing the selector emits matches those rows, the verdict falls through to `unknown`, and an outage becomes indistinguishable from missing evidence — the distinction AC-6 exists for. Every other row still passes, because only this one was renamed by normalization; restoring the normalized key passes |
| P26 | Omit `classification` for the eight non-miss states | a scratch copy of the classifier | scenario 16a fails on eight of its ten cases: a record with no key is indistinguishable from one written before the field existed, so a later report cannot tell *judged and not a miss* from *not judged*; restoring `not_a_miss` passes |
| P24 | Reserve a fixed five characters for each count instead of their actual width | a scratch copy of the renderer | scenario 13c-ii fails in both directions: a seven-digit count under-reserves and the line exceeds 200 characters, while a one-digit count over-reserves and drops a path that would have fit. Ordinary records with three- or four-digit counts pass, which is every other scenario; restoring the actual-width computation passes |
| P23 | Append paths until the budget is full, then add the remainder text | a scratch copy of the renderer | scenario 13c-i fails: a record sized to the boundary emits a line longer than 200 characters, over-long by exactly the `, +N more` that announces the omission — so the one line guaranteed to be short is the one that says it left something out. Scenario 13's ordinary cases pass, because they are nowhere near the boundary; restoring the reserved budget passes |
| P20 | Store only the three paths the summary line will name | a scratch copy of the record builder | scenario 13a-i fails: a twelve-file round's record holds three paths and the other nine are unrecoverable, so AC-16's read-back is incomplete and #1657 cannot answer which files external reviewers find things in. Every other scenario passes, because they all read the rendered line rather than the record; restoring the complete list passes |
| P17 | Emit the first `commit_id` when a round's artifacts name two | a scratch copy of an adapter's head extraction | scenario 13e's two-commit case fails: a head is emitted for a round whose findings straddle a push, so the record names a commit some of the findings do not belong to and a `clean_same_commit` can follow from it. The plant looks like ordinary defaulting and only a fixture that straddles a push exposes it; restoring the no-head rule passes |
| P15 | Substitute `loop_head_sha` for a missing `REVIEWED_HEAD` | a scratch copy of the attribution gate | scenario 13d fails: a round whose external reviewer never stated its head produces a record, and a `clean_same_commit` in it enters the **confirmed** count on the loop's inference about what the reviewer read. AC-11 requires no record when the commit cannot be established, and `clean_same_commit` is defined against the commit the external reviewer *reviewed*. The plant is the tempting one — it makes an empty telemetry produce data — which is why it is planted rather than argued about; restoring the no-fallback rule passes |
| P6 | Enforce the 200-character bound by truncating the finished line | a scratch copy of the renderer | scenario 13's long-path case fails: truncation removes the tail, which is where the local evidence state and the classification sit, so the line that survives is the one carrying paths and no verdict — exactly inverted from what a reader needs; restoring build-order enforcement passes |

Seventeen proofs plant the overclaiming direction because that is the direction with
no symptom: every one of them produces a plausible number, and a number is
believed. P3 is the one to read twice — its plant passes every test written
against a healthy repository, and only a fixture with a deliberately deleted
object exposes it.

## Implementation Order

0. **Hard stop**: confirm #1648 is implemented and merged into
   `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness`, and that its per-reviewer head
   evidence matches what its plan describes. If it does not, stop and revise
   this plan. **Verify**: the merged commit and the field names it introduced.
1. Add `reviewer_loop_commit_ancestry`, capturing every `git` status with
   `|| status=$?`. **Verify**: scenarios 4, 5, 5a and 5b in the new suite,
   including the deleted-object fixture and the errexit check.
1a. Collect `platform_result_records` from the raw `platform_result` and
   `platform_reason` at the per-platform call site, and write it into the entry
   as `platform_results` — outcome fields only, **no** head; heads stay in
   #1648's `reviewed_heads[]`. **Verify**: scenarios 6b, 14 and 3b — all seven
   rows of the normalization table, in particular the two `skipped` reasons and
   `escalate`, which `platform_result_tokens` cannot distinguish.
2. Add `reviewer_loop_local_latest_verdict`, taking the history payload and the
   newline-delimited configured-platform list tested with `grep -Fxq`, and
   compose the current round's
   `platform_result_records` **and** its `reviewed_heads[]` into the payload at
   the call site before selecting.
   **Verify**: scenarios 1a, 1b, 2b and 2c first — a selector that reads only
   persisted entries passes every other scenario in this list, and a
   comma-delimited membership test passes every one that configures a single
   platform. **Verify**: scenarios 1, 2, 3, 3a and 3b — recency
   over cleanliness, the two absent-reviewer values kept apart by the
   configuration argument alone, and the `unknown` fallback for pre-change
   entries.
3. Add `reviewer_loop_local_evidence_state`. **Verify**: scenarios 6 and 6a —
   one case per row, both routes to `unknown`, and a local verdict with no
   reviewer-supplied head.
3a. Extend each external adapter to emit `REVIEWED_HEAD` from the artifact it
   already consumes, following the adapter table row by row and re-reading each
   function before writing its extraction. The two local companion scripts,
   `haystack` and `coderabbit-cli`, print the key themselves as
   `local-ai-reviewer.sh` does. No head is emitted when the artifacts name more
   than one commit or none. **Verify**: scenarios 13e and 13f — the four
   artifact shapes, and one case per adapter including
   `claude-code-action`'s no-head result.
4. Add `reviewer_loop_missed_finding_records` with its four exclusions as early
   `continue`s, joining each platform's head from `reviewed_heads[]` inside the
   per-platform loop — no round-level head argument — and storing the
   **complete** de-duplicated path list. Attribution
   uses the reviewer's own `REVIEWED_HEAD` and has **no fallback**;
   `loop_head_sha` must not be substituted. **Verify**: scenario 13a-i first —
   a builder that stores three paths passes every other scenario, because every
   other one reads the line rather than the record. Then
   scenarios 7, 8, 9, 10, 13b, 13d and 16 — including the
   unattributable-commit case, which must produce no record **and** report the
   attribution reason.
5. Extend `reviewer_loop_history_build_entry` with `missed_findings`, schema
   string unchanged. **Verify**: scenario 14, field by field.
6. Change the render path so an unappendable history is **not** re-rendered,
   and add the eligibility-then-writability ordering and the row-4 report.
   **Verify**: scenarios 11, 11a, 12 and 12a — the byte-for-byte comparison
   against a saved prior body, the four unavailable reasons, and all three
   ineligible rows, including the unattributable one that only a
   writability-last ordering passes.
7. Add the summary renderer: de-duplicate paths before counting and naming,
   reserve `remainder_max` in the budget before appending any path, and compute
   the actual remainder from the paths named. **Verify**: scenarios 13, 13a,
   13a-i, 13c, 13c-i, 13c-ii, 13c-iii, 16a, 16b and 15 — the zero-path line, the
   eight-findings-over-three-files case, the three remainder forms, the
   complete stored path list, the boundary case that exposes an unreserved
   budget, and the worst realistic line with both counts rendered in full.
8. Update Protocol 93 and the `--help` block, and add
   `changelog.d/1651.added.missed-finding-telemetry.md`. **Verify**: runbook
   **Step 12a**, which reads both documentation surfaces against the
   implementation, and confirm the fragment's name matches
   `<item>.<kind>.<slug>.md` with a bare `1651`.
10. Produce the thirty planted-violation proofs (P1-P30) and record them in the PR
   with the command, file, line and both outcomes for each.

## Rollback

Revert the implementation PR. What it removes:

- two history-entry arrays, `platform_results` and `missed_findings`;
- three derivation functions — the ancestry classifier, the verdict selector,
  and the evidence-state mapping — plus the record builder;
- the summary renderer and its remainder logic;
- the `REVIEWED_HEAD` emission added to **eight** of the ten external platforms
  in the adapter table. Six are adapter changes inside `pr-review-loop.sh`
  (`greptile`, `codex-github`, `copilot`, `bugbot`, `devin`, `coderabbit`); two
  are changes to the companion scripts the table already counts,
  `haystack-reviewer.sh` and `coderabbit-cli-reviewer.sh`. The other two,
  `claude-code-action` and `pr-agent`, are **not** modified: neither names a
  commit in its own output, so both deliberately emit no head;
- the render-path change that preserves an unappendable history, which
  **reverts to overwriting it with an empty stub** — the one part of the revert
  that restores a defect rather than removing a feature, and the reason a
  revert should be followed by re-applying that change alone if the history
  matters;
- the Protocol 93, `--help` and changelog-fragment updates, and the two test
  suites.

Historical entries keep their `platform_results` and `missed_findings` keys,
which readers ignore. Nothing outside this item's own code reads them, and
#1648's `reviewed_heads[]` is untouched by the revert — the adapters simply stop
filling it for external platforms, returning it to the `not-reported` rendering
#1648 already handles.
