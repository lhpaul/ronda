# Smoke Test Runbook: fix(post-merge-cleanup) — Contradictory Log Output and Missing Tracker Status Update

**Feature**: Unified issue-number detection and automatic tracker status update in `post-merge-cleanup.sh`
**Spec**: [1_post-merge-cleanup-log-and-tracker_specs.md](../../specs/developments/20260417203259_post-merge-cleanup-log-and-tracker/1_post-merge-cleanup-log-and-tracker_specs.md)
**Created in**: Plan Ready stage
**Updated in**: In Development stage

---

## Prerequisites

Before running this smoke test:

- [ ] You are in the repository root (replace the path with your local clone location): `cd <your-local-clone-of-ai-dev-framework-template>`
- [ ] `gh` CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- [ ] `shellcheck` is available (optional but recommended): `shellcheck --version`
- [ ] **The implementation from this plan must already be landed before running this smoke test.** `scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh` must contain the unified `BRANCH_TYPE`/`ISSUE_NUMBER` extraction, the `update_tracker_status` helper, and the `Spec Ready` / `Plan Ready` / `Merged` status transitions described in the plan. This runbook validates post-implementation behavior; running it against the current `develop` state (where the script is unchanged) will fail Steps 1–5 because the expected output does not yet exist
- [ ] For Steps 3 and 5, you have a real merged implementation PR whose head branch is `feature/184-smoke-test-dummy`; export its number as `MERGED_FEATURE_PR_NUMBER`. Implementation branch remote cleanup is intentionally bound to the exact merged PR.
- [ ] For Step 5 (tracker update), you have access to a GitHub Projects v2 project with Status options: `Spec Ready`, `Plan Ready`, `Merged`

> **Important**: Steps 1–4 can be run without a real GitHub Projects setup by checking only the log output and return code. Step 5 requires a live project. Use `GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER` and `GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER` environment variables to point at a test project if needed.

## Smoke Test Steps

### Step 0: Prepare test branches

Create four dummy local branches to use as inputs. These do not need to be pushed to origin or have any commits beyond the current `develop` HEAD.

```bash
git checkout develop
git branch spec/184-smoke-test-dummy
git branch implementation-plan/184-smoke-test-dummy
git branch feature/184-smoke-test-dummy
git branch feature/my-legacy-feature
```

**Expected result**: All four branches created locally. You are still on `develop`.

---

### Step 1: Spec branch — single log line, no "No issue number detected"

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 1 and 4

```bash
# Capture output; the script will try to delete the branch and switch to develop.
# We need to be on develop already and not on the test branch.
# The script exits 0 even if tracker update warns.
output=$(./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh spec/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>&1)
exit_code=$?
echo "$output"
echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
```

**Expected result**:

1. Output contains exactly **one** line that mentions issue `#184` (e.g., contains "184" and "stays open" or "Spec Ready").
2. Output does **not** contain the phrase `No issue number detected`.
3. Output **does not** contain two separate messages about the issue — only one.
4. Script exits 0.
5. Local branch `spec/184-smoke-test-dummy` is deleted.
6. If GitHub Projects is configured: output contains a line about "Updating tracker status" or "Spec Ready"; project board for issue #184 shows `Spec Ready`.
7. If GitHub Projects is not configured (env vars absent): output contains a `Warning:` line mentioning missing project config; script still exits 0.

---

### Step 2: Implementation-plan branch — single log line, tracker update for Plan Ready

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 2 and 5

```bash
# Re-create the implementation-plan branch only if it does not already exist
# (Step 1 deleted the spec/* branch, so the implementation-plan/* one should
# already be present from its creation above — the command is a no-op in that
# case; if a previous run removed it, this recreates it).
git branch implementation-plan/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>/dev/null || true
output=$(./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh implementation-plan/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>&1)
exit_code=$?
echo "$output"
echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
```

**Expected result**:

1. Output contains exactly **one** line mentioning issue `#184`.
2. Output does **not** contain `No issue number detected`.
3. Script exits 0.
4. Local branch `implementation-plan/184-smoke-test-dummy` is deleted.
5. If GitHub Projects is configured: output mentions `Plan Ready`; project board for issue #184 shows `Plan Ready`.
6. If GitHub Projects is not configured: `Warning:` line present; script exits 0.

---

### Step 3: Feature branch — issue close preserved, tracker update for Merged

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 3

```bash
git branch feature/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>/dev/null || true
output=$(./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh --pr "$MERGED_FEATURE_PR_NUMBER" feature/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>&1)
exit_code=$?
echo "$output"
echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
```

**Expected result**:

1. Output does **not** contain `No issue number detected`.
2. Script attempts to close issue #184 (may log "Issue #184 is already CLOSED" or attempt `gh issue close` — both are acceptable).
3. Script exits 0.
4. Local branch `feature/184-smoke-test-dummy` is deleted.
5. If GitHub Projects is configured: output mentions `Merged`; project board for issue #184 shows `Merged`.
6. If GitHub Projects is not configured: `Warning:` line present; script exits 0.

---

### Step 4: Branch with no issue number — single skip message, no tracker update

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 6

```bash
git branch feature/my-legacy-feature 2>/dev/null || true
output=$(./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh feature/my-legacy-feature 2>&1)
exit_code=$?
echo "$output"
echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
```

**Expected result**:

1. Output contains exactly **one** line matching `No issue number detected in branch name`.
2. Output does **not** contain any mention of a tracker update.
3. Script exits 0.
4. Local branch `feature/my-legacy-feature` is deleted.

---

### Step 5: GitHub Projects misconfigured — warning, clean exit

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 7

```bash
# Temporarily unset project env vars to simulate missing config
git branch feature/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>/dev/null || true
output=$(GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER="" GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER="" \
  ./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh --pr "$MERGED_FEATURE_PR_NUMBER" feature/184-smoke-test-dummy 2>&1)
exit_code=$?
echo "$output"
echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
```

**Expected result**:

1. Script outputs a `Warning:` line mentioning missing `GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER` or `GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER`.
2. Script exits 0 (git cleanup completed successfully).
3. If the branch was not already deleted, it is deleted now. (If deleted in Step 3, re-create it first with `git branch feature/184-smoke-test-dummy`.)

---

### Last Step: Verify main working tree is clean

```bash
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected result**: `git status --porcelain` outputs nothing (no uncommitted changes), and `git branch --show-current` outputs `develop`.

## Assertions Checklist

Each checkbox maps to an acceptance criterion from the spec.

- [ ] **AC 1**: `post-merge-cleanup.sh spec/<N>-...` → exactly one log line about issue; no "No issue number detected" message (Step 1)
- [ ] **AC 2**: `post-merge-cleanup.sh implementation-plan/<N>-...` → exactly one log line about issue; no "No issue number detected" message (Step 2)
- [ ] **AC 3**: `post-merge-cleanup.sh feature/<N>-...` → GitHub Projects v2 Status set to `Merged`; existing issue-close behavior preserved (Step 3)
- [ ] **AC 4**: `post-merge-cleanup.sh spec/<N>-...` → GitHub Projects v2 Status set to `Spec Ready` (Step 1, with live project)
- [ ] **AC 5**: `post-merge-cleanup.sh implementation-plan/<N>-...` → GitHub Projects v2 Status set to `Plan Ready` (Step 2, with live project)
- [ ] **AC 6**: Branch with no numeric issue number → single "No issue number detected" line; no tracker update (Step 4)
- [ ] **AC 7**: GitHub Projects misconfigured → `Warning:` line; script exits 0; git cleanup completes (Step 5)

| `Local branch 'spec/184-smoke-test-dummy' does not exist`        | Branch was not created in Step 0 | Run `git branch spec/184-smoke-test-dummy` from `develop`                          |
| `You are on 'develop'. Pass the merged branch name…`             | Passed wrong argument or no arg  | Pass the branch name explicitly as the first argument                              |
| `Warning: GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER or GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER not set` | Env vars not exported            | Export `GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER` and `GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER` before running           |
| `Warning: could not resolve project ID`                          | Wrong project number or owner    | Verify with `gh project list --owner <OWNER>`                                      |
| `Warning: issue #184 not found in project`                       | Issue not added to the project   | Add issue #184 to the project via GitHub UI or `gh project item-add`               |
| Two log lines appear for spec/plan branch                        | Bug not fully fixed              | Review the unified extraction block; ensure `STAGE_ISSUE` variable path is removed |

## Known Limitations

- Steps 1–4 validate log output structure but cannot assert tracker field values without a live GitHub Projects setup. Use Step 5 env-var override to test the failure path without real credentials.
- The script runs real `git checkout develop` and `git branch -D` operations; ensure test branches are truly throwaway before running.
