## Prerequisites

- [ ] You are reviewing the implementation PR for #1652.
- [ ] The PR targets `develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness`.
- [ ] #1648 is merged into that branch, so per-reviewer head evidence exists.
- [ ] `bash`, `jq` and `git` are available. No network access and no live GitHub
      mutation are required — every step runs against harness fixtures with
      mocked `gh` commands and inline ledger payloads.

## Smoke Test Steps

### Step 1: Two tiers — path decides first, body escalates second

**Maps to**: brief scope bullet 1.

Only **blocking** findings reach this rule at all: `small_findings_paths` is
built from `reviewer_loop_blocking_paths_from_output`. Advisory findings are out
of scope, so every case below is a finding the reviewer already said must be
fixed.

1. Source the loop in harness mode:

   <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

   ```bash
   HARNESS_MODE=1 source scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh
   ```

2. Call `reviewer_loop_path_is_normative_document` on the eleven first-tier
   patterns and on four controls: `tests/fixtures/x.json`,
   `__snapshots__/x.snap`, `CHANGELOG.md` and
   `scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh`.
3. Run the loop three times with a blocking finding on
   `docs/specs/developments/x/1_x_specs.md`: a body naming a decision matrix; a
   body reading only "trailing whitespace"; and a body reading "required error
   handling is missing", which contains **no** listed contract term.
4. Run it twice with a blocking finding on `CHANGELOG.md`:
   once cosmetic, once naming a decision matrix.

**Expected result**: step 2 matches all eleven patterns and none of the four
controls. All three of step 3's findings are **non-small** — including the third,
which no vocabulary list would have caught. Step 4's cosmetic finding is
**small** and its contract finding is not.

Step 3's third case is the point of the two-tier design. A vocabulary-only rule
catches only findings that happen to use its words; *"required error handling is
missing"* and *"this permits an invalid value"* are contract findings containing
none of them, and would fall through and be cleared. The path tier is what makes
the guard fail-closed, and the vocabulary tier only escalates where a cosmetic
tail is still wanted.

Step 4 is the counterweight: the normative list is deliberately narrow, so
`CHANGELOG.md`, fixtures, snapshots and other non-shipped `*.md` outside the
normative set keep the cosmetic-tail escape. `docs/project/**` is not among
them — `AGENTS.md` designates those four documents as authoritative guidance,
so they belong in the first tier.

### Step 2: A contract-surface finding is never small, wherever it lives

**Maps to**: brief scope bullet 1, the path-independent half.

1. Call `reviewer_loop_finding_touches_contract_surface` with one body per row of
   the plan's contract-surface table.
2. Call it with three cosmetic bodies: a typo report, a trailing-whitespace
   report, and a heading-capitalisation report.
3. Call `reviewer_loop_all_findings_are_small` with a finding on
   `CHANGELOG.md` — non-shipped and **non-normative** — whose **body names a
   decision matrix**.

**Expected result**: every contract-surface row matches; all three cosmetic
bodies do not; and step 3 reports the finding as **not** small. Step 3 is the
core of this item — the original rule would have called that finding small
because of its path alone. The path must be non-normative: on a normative path
tier 1 returns non-small on its own, so the escalation could be broken outright
and this step would still pass.

### Step 3: The parser does not over-match or under-match

**Maps to**: the parser-risk addendum.

Call the contract-surface predicate with each case and read match / no-match:

| Body | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| `the delegates list is wrong` | no match — `delegates` must not match `gate` |
| `AC-1 is untestable` | match |
| `AC-10 is untestable` | match — the pattern is `AC-[0-9]+`; a single-digit form would fail here, and this repository's specs run to `AC-17` |
| `AC-147 is untestable` | match |
| `see AC- for details` | no match — a bare `AC-` with no digits |
| `the decision gate is inconsistent`, run under **BSD grep** | match — the boundary uses `(^\|[^[:alnum:]_])…([^[:alnum:]_]\|$)`, not `\b`, which BSD grep does not recognise |
| `use a microscope analogy` | no match — `microscope` must not match `scope` |
| `the heading state is inconsistent` | no match — bare `state` is not a matched term |
| `a typo in the scope section` | no match — bare `scope` is not a matched term |
| `the status column is misaligned` | no match — bare `status` is not a matched term |
| `the gate heading needs a capital` | no match — bare `gate` is not a matched term |
| `fix the proof reading typo` | no match — bare `proof` is not a matched term |
| `parse is misspelled here` | no match — bare `parse` is not a matched term |
| `the contract section has a trailing space` | no match — bare `contract` is not a matched term |
| `the decision gate is inconsistent` | match — the qualified phrase |
| `failXclosed is wrong` | no match — each spelling is listed literally, never via a wildcard `.` separator |
| `the allow list is incomplete` | no match — only the hyphenated `allow-list` is a listed spelling |
| `this row is out of scope` | match — the qualified phrase |
| `the evidence state table is wrong` | match — the qualified phrase |
| `Acceptance Criteria are inconsistent` | match — case-insensitive |
| `FAIL-CLOSED contract is violated` | match — case-insensitive |
| a body quoting `decision gate` inside a fenced code block | match |
| a body containing a URL whose path contains `fail-closed` | match — a listed spelling still matches inside a URL, and `/` and `-` are both non-word characters, so the boundaries hold |
| a body containing a URL whose path contains only `scope` | no match — bare `scope` is not a listed phrase, wherever it appears |
| `""` (empty) | no match |
| a whitespace-only body | no match |
| `this is not a decision gate` | match — the classifier does not read intent |
| a multi-line body whose only term is on the last line | match |

**Expected result**: exactly as tabulated. Two groups carry the weight, and both
guard the **restrictive** direction:

- The two **substring** rows. Without word-boundary matching, `delegates`
  matches `gate` and nearly every finding becomes non-small.
- The seven **bare common word** rows. Every matched term is a phrase or a
  qualified form precisely so that ordinary prose — "the heading state is
  inconsistent", "a typo in the scope section" — does not read as
  contract-bearing. An earlier draft listed these words bare; they were removed
  for this reason, and the three qualified rows at the end confirm the phrases
  still match.

Over-matching here disables the terminal rule while looking like a tightening,
which is the more likely of the two mistakes because it appears to succeed.

### Step 3f: Findings survive collection as path/body pairs

**Maps to**: the "path/body pairing is lost in collection" risk.

1. Run the loop with **two findings on the same path** — one cosmetic, one
   naming a decision matrix.
2. Run it with a body emitted as `some prose\ndecision matrix is wrong`, where
   the `\n` is the literal two-character sequence `local-ai-reviewer.sh` writes.
2a. Run it twice more: once where the body's original text contained a **real
   newline**, once where it contained a **literal `\n`**. Both arrive
   identically encoded.
3. Run it with findings from two platforms and read the summary line.
4. Run it four more times with hostile characters: a **tab in the path**, a
   **tab in the body**, a double quote in the body, and a backslash in the body.

**Expected result**: run 1 is **non-small** — a collector that deduplicated by
path could have kept only the cosmetic record and called the round small. Run 2 is **non-small**, which requires the `\n` sequence to be normalised to a
space before matching; against the raw string the sequence leaves an `n` abutting
`decision`, so the word boundary fails.

Both of run 2a's cases are also **non-small**, and they are indistinguishable by
construction: `local-ai-reviewer.sh` does not escape pre-existing backslashes
before encoding newlines, so the two originals produce identical bytes and no
downstream step can tell them apart. The plan does not claim to — it normalises
rather than decodes, and the classification is correct either way. Confirm the
**stored record** still carries the body as received; the
normalisation is applied only to the string handed to the matcher. The summary
line carries no bodies — only the derived causes — so the record is the only
place the fidelity check can read. Run 3's summary names the platform that produced the deciding finding.

All four of run 4's cases are classified from **intact fields** and the contract
term is still found. These are the cases a delimiter-separated record would
corrupt: git paths may contain tabs and `local-ai-reviewer.sh` does not escape
tabs in bodies, so a `<path><TAB><platform><TAB><body>` form would shift columns
and classify a blocker against the wrong text. The record is JSON built with
`jq --arg` and read with `jq -r`, which escapes and decodes every field.

### Step 3g: Unclassifiable rounds stay non-small

**Maps to**: the two fail-closed guards carried over from
`reviewer_loop_all_paths_non_shipped`.

1. Run the loop with an **empty** findings array — no blocking finding was
   collected at all.
2. Run it with two records where one is plainly cosmetic and carries an **empty
   path**, and the other is cosmetic on `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Expected result**: both rounds are **non-small**, and the terminal rule does
not fire on either.

Run 2 is the one that inverts without the guard. `reviewer_loop_path_is_non_shipped_artifact`
lists `""` among its non-shipped cases, so an empty path reads as non-shipped
and a cosmetically worded pathless blocker would be classified small. The old
path collector never reached that branch — it skipped empty lines and then
required `saw_path` — so today such a round is non-small. Both guards are
therefore restatements of current behavior, not new strictness, and both are
needed because the predicate they used to rest on is no longer the one being
called.

### Step 4: Counted rounds must be on the current head

**Maps to**: brief scope bullet 2.

1. Seed a ledger with two prior small-findings rounds whose
   `classification_head` is an **older** commit and one whose
   `classification_head` is the **current** head. Run the counter.
1a. Seed four prior entries whose `classification_head` equals the current head
   and run the counter for each: two contributing platforms both naming that
   head; two contributing platforms with one on an older commit; one
   contributing platform naming it while a **non-contributing** platform
   reports no head at all; and a pre-change entry carrying no
   `contributing_platforms[]`.
1b. Seed a prior entry whose `head_sha` equals the current head while its
   `classification_head` is an older commit; then the two swapped. Run the
   counter for each.
2. Seed a ledger whose prior round has an **absent** head; then an **empty**
   head; then a synthetic `unknown-<epoch>-<pid>-<rand>` placeholder. Run the
   counter for each.
3. Read the counter's **stop reason** in each run above, plus one run where the
   walk reaches the end of the ledger and one where it stops at a non-small
   round. Confirm the counter emits one compact JSON object carrying both
   `count` and `stop_reason`, and that the caller reads both from it.
3a. Run it with the counter emitting a malformed object, then with
   `stop_reason` missing, then with a `stop_reason` outside the closed set.
4. With `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_SMALL_FINDINGS_STOP_ROUNDS` at its default `2`, seed two
   prior small rounds on a stale head and run the terminal decision.
5. Seed two prior small rounds **on the current head**, so the prior count is
   sufficient, and give the deciding round counted findings from **two**
   platforms. Run the terminal decision for four combinations: both platforms
   reporting `loop_head_sha`; one reporting a different head; one reporting no
   head; both stale.

**Expected result**: step 1 returns **1**, not 3 — a round classified against an
older commit ends the consecutive run rather than extending it.

Step 1a's four seeds give: counts, run ends (`stale_head`), **counts**, run
ends. The first two show that a round *classified* against the current head is
not evidence that every *contributor* reviewed it — the same per-contributor
rule the deciding round is held to in step 5, so both halves of `prior + 1` are
checked identically.

The **third** is the one that keeps the rule usable. `reviewed_heads[]` lists
every configured platform, including ones that returned clean, were skipped, or
never report a head. Requiring a current head from all of them would break the
count permanently on any repository where a reviewer legitimately does not
report — disabling the terminal rule from the restrictive side. Only the
platforms in `contributing_platforms[]` are checked; the rest are ignored.

The fourth is backward compatibility in the fail-closed direction: an entry
written before this change has no `contributing_platforms[]`, so it cannot
demonstrate contributor currency and ends the run.

Step 1b's first seed ends the run with `stale_head` and its second counts. The
counter must read `classification_head` and never `head_sha`: #1648's ledger
uses `head_sha` as the identity key the #1502 cap counters bucket on, and it can
legitimately differ from the commit the round actually described. All three cases in step 2 also end
the run. Step 3 returns `stale_head`, `head_unknown` (three times), `exhausted`
and `not_small` respectively; a bare count could not distinguish the first two,
which `SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY` must. Both values arrive in one JSON object,
so a caller cannot associate a count with the wrong reason.

All three of step 3a's cases are treated as count `0` with `head_unknown`, and
the terminal rule does **not** fire. An unreadable counter cannot demonstrate a
bounded consecutive run, and the rule exists to be demonstrated. Step 4 does **not** fire the terminal
rule and reports `SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY=stale_head`.

**Step 5**: only the first combination may fire. The other three must not —
`stale_head` for the differing head, `head_unknown` for the missing one, and
`stale_head` for both stale — and the summary line must name the platform
responsible.

Two things are being guarded. The consecutive run is `prior entries + 1`, and
the `+ 1` is the round being decided, so verifying only the prior entries would
let the rule terminate on findings describing a commit that is no longer the
head. And a round can aggregate blockers from several platforms, so the check is
per contributor: one platform's current-head evidence says nothing about what
another was looking at, which is why **every** contributor must report
`loop_head_sha` rather than any one of them.

An unprovable head must end the run rather than be skipped over: the terminal
rule exists to be demonstrated, and a round whose head cannot be established
cannot demonstrate anything.

### Step 5: The blocked reason is visible

**Maps to**: the "cannot tell a refusing loop from a failing one" risk.

1. Run the loop for each of four situations: a shipped-path finding, a
   contract-surface finding on a non-shipped path, a stale counted head, and a
   counted head that is a placeholder.
2. Run it once where the terminal rule fires.
3. Read `SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY` and the summary's small-findings line.

4. Run it three more times. Two carry genuinely co-occurring causes: a round
   with both a shipped-path and a contract-surface finding, and a round whose
   findings are all small but which has one stale contributor and one reporting
   no head. The third is a **mutual-exclusivity** case rather than a
   co-occurrence: a round carrying a contract-surface finding **together with** a
   contributor on a stale head, where the two inputs are present but only one
   becomes a recorded cause.

**Expected result**: the four situations report `shipped_path`,
`contract_surface`, `stale_head` and `head_unknown` respectively; the firing run
reports an **empty** value, as does a run whose consecutive count was simply
short — `exhausted` and `not_small` describe an ordinary short run and are not
blocking reasons.

The three runs report `shipped_path`, `stale_head` and `contract_surface`
respectively.

The first two are the co-occurrence cases, and they test the two **within-group**
precedences: `shipped_path` outranks
`contract_surface` because a shipped path is a property of the artifact and
needs no reading of the finding text to act on, and `stale_head` outranks
`head_unknown` because a known-different head is the more specific statement.
Both are the cases proof P9 inverts.

The third run tests something else: it carries a contract-surface finding *and*
a contributor on a stale head, and must report `contract_surface` with **no
currency cause recorded at all**. Content and currency causes are mutually
exclusive by construction — the head of a counted round is only asked about once
the round qualifies as a small-findings round, so a non-small finding means the
head check is never reached. There is no content-versus-currency ordering to
test, and this run is the guard against re-introducing one.

In the first two runs the **summary line still names every cause present** —
precedence reduces only the single-valued key, and nothing is hidden by it.

The summary line names the matched contract-surface identity, not just that some
surface matched: `reviewer_loop_finding_touches_contract_surface` prints the
identity (`acceptance_criteria`, `fail_closed_semantics`, and so on) rather than
returning a bare boolean, so the renderer has a defined input. A body matching
two surfaces prints the first in table order. The summary line names the specific contract surface
or shipped path that kept the round non-small, so the reason is legible on the
PR without reading loop output.

### Step 6: The #1661 regression does not fire (tier 1)

**Maps to**: brief scope bullet 3, and the incidence recorded in the plan's
Verification Log.

1. Run the replay suite:

   <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

   ```bash
   bash scripts/development-workflow/tests/test-small-finding-terminal-policy.sh
   ```

2. Inspect the case built from PR #1661's actual history — consecutive rounds
   whose only findings were on `docs/specs/developments/**` with bodies naming
   fail-closed semantics, decision-matrix rows and acceptance criteria.

**Expected result**: the terminal rule does **not** fire, where on the
unmodified loop it fires on round two.

This is **tier-1 coverage**. Those findings are on `docs/specs/developments/**`,
so their bodies are irrelevant to the outcome and this case would pass even if
the contract-surface test were completely broken. It proves the epic's actual
regression is closed; Step 6b is what proves tier 2 works.

### Step 6b: Tier 2 in isolation

**Maps to**: brief scope bullet 1, the content half.

1. In the same suite, inspect the case replaying the #1661 ledger shape and
   bodies on `CHANGELOG.md` — a non-normative, non-shipped
   path.

**Expected result**: the terminal rule does **not** fire. Here the path alone
would make the findings small, so only the contract-surface test can produce
that result. This is the only replay that exercises tier 2 end to end, and it
fails if the vocabulary matching is broken — which Step 6's case would not. This is the exact sequence that produced
24 `RESULT=clean` outcomes carrying live blocking findings across PRs #1660,
#1661 and #1662; the findings involved were contract defects — a deny-list where
the contract claimed fail-closed, an empty set treated as passing, an
unvalidated bound that defeated its own cap — not typographical ones.

### Step 7: The mechanism still terminates on a cosmetic tail

**Maps to**: the "tightening removes the mechanism" risk.

1. In the same suite, inspect the case replaying **Step 6b's** ledger exactly —
   same round count, adjacency, head and the same
   `CHANGELOG.md` path — with only the bodies changed to
   cosmetic ones.

**Expected result**: the terminal rule **does** fire. If Step 6b passes and this
fails, the change did not tighten tier 2 — it made it match everything.

Pairing with Step 6b rather than Step 6 is what makes this the strong form: the
two differ in **body alone** on a tier-2 path, so opposite outcomes isolate the
contract-surface test exactly. Pairing it with Step 6 would prove nothing, since
tier 1 makes those findings non-small whatever the body says.

### Step 8: Planted-violation proofs are present and two-directional

**Maps to**: `REVIEW.md` § Planted-violation proof.

1. Read the implementation PR's `Planted-Violation Proofs` heading.
2. Confirm P1 through P22 each record the command, the file and line of the
   planted violation, and both outcomes.

**Expected result**: twenty-two proofs in four groups — **sixteen** permissive,
**four** restrictive, **one** observability, **one** fidelity, per the plan's
proof-group table.
The permissive group is P1 through P5, P8, P10, P11, P12, P14, P15, P16, P17,
P20, P21 and P22 — sixteen — reproducing the original bug in each of the ways it
can return; P22 drops the empty-array and empty-path guards and requires Step
3g to fail; P8 skips the current round's head check and requires Step 4's
fifth run to fail; P10 reads `head_sha` instead of `classification_head` and
requires Step 4's step 1b to fail; P14 breaks the contract-surface
matching entirely and requires Step 6b to fail while Step 6 still passes, which
is precisely why Step 6b exists; P21 has the counter emit the count alone and requires Step 4's step 3a to fail;
P20 narrows the acceptance-criteria pattern to a single digit and requires
Step 3's `AC-10` and `AC-147` rows to fail; P15 deduplicates the findings
array, P16
matches the raw body without normalising, and P17 replaces the JSON record with
a tab-separated one — all three requiring Step 3f to fail; **P18** stores the
normalised body instead of the raw one, requiring Step 3f's fidelity check to
fail while its matching checks still pass; P11 checks only a
prior entry's
`classification_head` and skips its `reviewed_heads[]`, requiring step 1a to
fail; **P12** drops tier 1 and leaves the vocabulary test as the only guard, requiring Step 1's third case — a contract finding containing no listed term — to fail. **Four** plant the
**restrictive** direction, and none is optional: **P19** requires a current head
from every `reviewed_heads[]` entry rather than only the contributing ones, and
requires Step 4's step 1a third seed to fail; **P13** replaces the portable
boundary with `\b` and requires Step 3's BSD row to fail; **P6** widens the
normative list and requires Steps 1, 2 and 7 to fail; **P7** restores the bare
common words to the contract-surface list and requires Step 3's seven bare-word
rows and Step 7 to fail. A tightening that disables the mechanism would pass
every permissive proof while introducing a different defect, and it is the more
likely mistake because it looks like success.

**One** — **P9** — is neither, and forms the third group: it inverts both
**within-group** `SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY` precedences, reporting
`contract_surface` over `shipped_path` and `head_unknown` over `stale_head`.
There is no cross-group ordering to invert, because content and currency causes
are mutually exclusive. It requires Step 5's **first two** co-occurring runs to fail — the
content-group pair reporting `contract_surface` where a shipped path is present,
and the currency-group pair reporting `head_unknown` where a known-different
head is present. Both are genuine co-occurrences within a group, so both can
detect the inversion. P9 changes no
firing decision at all — the rule still terminates or refuses exactly as before
— and only changes which cause a maintainer is shown first. It is its own group
because a precedence defect is an **observability** defect, invisible to any
test that asserts only whether the rule fired.

### Step 9: Documentation agrees across all three surfaces

1. Read the small-findings section of
   `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`.
2. Read the added line in `REVIEW.md`.
3. Run `pr-review-loop.sh --help`.

**Expected result**: all three describe the same rule — a **blocking** finding
on a normative document is never small whatever it says,
a contract-surface finding is escalated on other documentation paths while a
cosmetic one there is not, **both** the prior counted rounds and the round being decided must be on
the current head, and an unknown head ends the run — and all three name the same
four `SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY` values. **None may describe the classification
as vocabulary-only**, and none may claim that *every* finding on a normative
document is non-small — only blocking findings reach this rule at all. Reading
them against Steps 1 through 5 must surface no contradiction.

### Step 10: Static checks

1. Run `shellcheck` on `scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh`.
2. Run

   <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/lint/workflow-shell-guard-lint.py \
     --base-ref origin/develop-internal-reviewer-effectiveness
   ```

   The implementation materially rewrites `pr-review-loop.sh`, whose path
   matches the guard's `scripts/development-workflow/*.sh` filter, and the
   guard runs on **added** diff lines — so it applies to this change and to no
   part of the repository's existing debt.
3. Run `markdownlint-cli2` on the two changed documentation files, this runbook
   and the implementation plan.

**Expected result**: all three tools exit 0.

---

## Rollback

Revert the implementation PR. The change is additive in behavior terms — two new
predicates, one renamed aggregate, one extra argument to the consecutive
counter, one new stdout key, and two documentation edits — and reverting
restores the previous, more permissive classification. No configuration
migration is involved: `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_SMALL_FINDINGS_STOP_ROUNDS` keeps its
name, default and validation throughout, since this item changes what counts as
a qualifying round rather than how many are required. Ledger entries written
while the change was live remain readable by the reverted loop, which ignores
the fields it does not know.
