## Smoke Test Steps

### Step 1: Fresh Session — No Scope Hint

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 12

1. Open a new session in the target platform (Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex)
2. Invoke `/retrospective` (or the platform equivalent) with no arguments
3. Observe: the agent queries GitHub for recent PR data
4. If findings are surfaced:
   - Verify each finding has a category label (from: Workflow & Process, Agent Behavior, Configuration, Documentation, Code Quality, Tooling)
   - Verify each finding has a severity signal (High, Medium, or Low)
   - Verify each finding has a recommended action (Address now or Add to backlog)
   - For one finding, choose "Skip" — verify the agent moves on without taking action
5. If no findings are surfaced:
   - Verify the agent communicates that no actionable opportunities were found
   - Verify the agent closes the retrospective gracefully

**Expected result**: Categorized findings are presented (or a graceful "no findings" message), and the agent does not take any action without the human's explicit choice.

### Step 2: Fresh Session — With Scope Hint

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 1

1. Open a new session
2. Invoke `/retrospective` with a specific PR number (e.g., `/retrospective PR #42`)
3. Verify findings are scoped to that PR (not unrelated recent PRs)

**Expected result**: Findings relate to the specified PR.

### Step 3: Address Now — Simple Fix

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 5, 12

1. From the findings in Step 1 or Step 2, choose "Address now" for a finding the agent assesses as simple
2. Verify the agent applies the fix directly
3. Verify the agent commits and pushes the change
4. Verify the agent reports what was changed (diff or summary)
5. Verify no new PR or review loop was opened

**Expected result**: Simple fix is committed and pushed; no new PR created.

### Step 4: Address Now — Complex Finding

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 6

1. If any finding is assessed as too complex for direct fix, choose "Address now" for it
2. Verify the agent recommends "Add to backlog" instead
3. Verify the agent explains why the fix is too complex for direct application

**Expected result**: Agent redirects to "Add to backlog" with explanation. (Note: this scenario depends on the findings surfaced; if no complex findings exist, note this step as N/A.)

### Step 5: Add to Backlog — New Issue

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 7, 12, 13

1. Verify the findings presentation (protocol Step 4) includes a **"Related existing item"** field for each finding (`#NNN — [title]` or "No existing backlog item found")
2. From the findings, choose "Add to backlog" for one finding that has **no related existing item**
3. Verify a new GitHub issue is created. For GitHub Projects, confirm it is added to the project with Type `Workflow`; for GitHub Issues-only setups, confirm the repository's workflow label/tag convention is applied.
4. Verify the issue has a descriptive title and body
5. Verify the agent returns the issue URL
6. Inspect the created issue: confirm the body includes enough context to understand the problem without the original conversation

**Expected result**: GitHub issue created with descriptive content and provider-appropriate workflow classification; URL returned.

### Step 5b: Add to Backlog — Expand Existing Issue

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 12, 13

1. From the findings, choose "Add to backlog" for one finding that has a **related existing item**
2. Verify the agent offers a choice: **Expand existing** or **Create new**
3. Choose "Expand existing"
4. Verify the agent appends the new observation to the existing issue body (via `gh issue edit --body-file`)
5. Verify the agent returns the updated issue URL
6. Inspect the updated issue on GitHub: confirm the new observation appears as an additional section

**Expected result**: Existing issue updated with new observation appended; URL returned. No duplicate issue created. (Note: this step requires a finding that matched an existing item; mark N/A if none are detected.)

### Step 6: Protocol 90 Integration — Post-Merge Retrospective Suggestion

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 9

1. Run a batch orchestration session (via `/run-work` or equivalent) that processes at least one item until all PRs reach `ready-for-human-review`
2. After the batch summary is displayed, verify the agent does **NOT** suggest a retrospective yet (PRs are not merged)
3. Simulate merge completion by telling the agent the PRs have been merged (or run `/batch-merge` / `/post-merge-cleanup`)
4. Verify the agent now suggests: "Would you like to run a retrospective on this batch's work?" (or similar wording)
5. Accept the suggestion
6. Verify the retrospective runs and presents findings (including conversation-context findings if available)

**Expected result**: Retrospective is NOT suggested after the batch summary; it is suggested only after the human confirms PRs have been merged. Runs when accepted.

### Step 7: Protocol 91 Integration — Standalone Item Post-Merge Suggestion

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 10

1. Run a single item via `/run-item-work` or equivalent (standalone, not dispatched by a batch orchestrator)
2. After the item reaches `ready-for-human-review` and the item summary is displayed, verify the agent does **NOT** suggest a retrospective yet
3. Simulate merge completion by telling the agent the PR has been merged (or run `/post-merge-cleanup`)
4. Verify the agent now suggests running a retrospective
5. Decline the suggestion
6. Verify the agent closes without running the retrospective

**Expected result**: Retrospective is NOT suggested immediately after the item summary; it is suggested only after the human confirms the PR has been merged. Skipped when declined.

### Step 8: Protocol 91 Integration — Batched Item Suppression

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 10

1. Run a batch orchestration session that dispatches at least one item via the Work Item Runner with `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`
2. After the dispatched item completes (reaches `ready-for-human-review`), verify the Work Item Runner does NOT suggest a retrospective
3. Verify the batch orchestrator (Protocol 90) also does not suggest a retrospective at the Step 6 summary — it defers until after merge confirmation

**Expected result**: Retrospective suggestion is suppressed entirely for batched items in the Work Item Runner; the batch orchestrator only suggests it after confirming PRs are merged.

### Step 9: Same-Session Conversation Context

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 8

1. During the retrospective in Step 6 or Step 7, verify findings include items sourced from conversation history (manual interventions, human corrections, agent deviations) in addition to GitHub data
2. Verify findings indicate their source (GitHub data only, or both GitHub and conversation context)

**Expected result**: Conversation-context findings are present when the retrospective runs in the same session as completed work.

### Last Step: Validate & Shut Down

- Verify all assertions in the checklist below are met

---

## Assertions Checklist

Each checkbox maps to an acceptance criterion from the spec.

- [ ] AC 1: A developer can invoke `/retrospective` in a fresh session and receive categorized improvement opportunities from GitHub PR data
- [ ] AC 2: When GitHub data is insufficient, the agent communicates "no findings" and closes gracefully
- [ ] AC 3: Each opportunity is labeled with category, severity signal, and recommended action
- [ ] AC 4: The developer can choose "Address now", "Add to backlog", or skip for each opportunity
- [ ] AC 5: "Address now" for a simple fix: agent applies, commits, pushes without new PR
- [ ] AC 6: "Address now" for a complex fix: agent recommends "Add to backlog" instead with explanation
- [ ] AC 7: "Add to backlog": agent creates GitHub issue directly and returns URL
- [ ] AC 13: Before presenting findings, agent queries the configured issue tracker for existing open items and annotates each finding with a related item reference or "No existing backlog item found"; when a related item exists and the human chooses "Expand existing", the agent appends the new observation to the existing issue rather than creating a duplicate
- [ ] AC 8: Same-session retrospective surfaces conversation-context findings alongside GitHub findings
- [ ] AC 9: Protocol 90 does NOT suggest retrospective after Step 6 batch summary; instead defers until human confirms PRs are merged
- [ ] AC 10: Protocol 91 does NOT suggest retrospective immediately after item summary; defers until human confirms PR is merged; suppressed entirely when `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`
- [ ] AC 11: `/retrospective` command/skill is available in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex
- [ ] AC 12: Agent never applies fixes or creates issues without human's explicit choice

## Known Limitations

- Step 4 (complex finding) depends on the retrospective surfacing a finding that is too complex; if all findings are simple, this step cannot be validated and should be marked N/A
- Step 5b (expand existing) depends on the retrospective surfacing a finding that matches an existing open backlog item; if no match is detected, this step cannot be validated and should be marked N/A
- Steps 6-8 require running full orchestration sessions, which may take significant time; these can be tested opportunistically during normal workflow usage rather than in a dedicated smoke test session
- Conversation-context analysis quality depends on the richness of the conversation history in the current session
