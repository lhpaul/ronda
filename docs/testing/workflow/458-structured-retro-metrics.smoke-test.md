## Smoke Test Steps

### Step 1: Verify metrics block is defined in `06-retrospective-protocol.md`

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 1, 2

1. Open `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06-retrospective-protocol.md`.
2. Locate Step 3d (Metrics Block) — it should appear between Steps 3c and Step 4.
3. Confirm Step 3d defines all six required fields: batch identifier, human interventions count, Step 5.2 violations count, automated-reviewer retry loops count, escalations count, and prior action item recurrence assessment.
4. Confirm each field has a clear, unambiguous definition (not just a label).
5. Confirm the "unavailable" rule is stated (BR-7).
6. Confirm that a value of zero is explicitly noted as valid.

**Expected result**: Step 3d is present; all six fields are defined with descriptions; "unavailable" rule and zero-validity are stated.

---

### Step 2: Verify metrics block is included in Step 4 output format

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 2

1. In the same file, locate Step 4 (Present Findings).
2. Confirm the metrics block is included in the structured output format shown in Step 4.

**Expected result**: Step 4 output format includes the metrics block section alongside improvement opportunities.

---

### Step 3: Verify append instruction is in Step 6

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 3

1. In the same file, locate Step 6 (Close).
2. Confirm Step 6 instructs the analyst to append the finalized metrics block to `docs/workflow/retro-metrics.md` after completing Step 5 actions.
3. Confirm the append instruction specifies the table row format.

**Expected result**: Step 6 references `docs/workflow/retro-metrics.md` and specifies how to format the appended row.

---

### Step 4: Verify "See also" reference to meta-retrospective protocol

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 8

1. Scroll to the end of `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06-retrospective-protocol.md`.
2. Confirm a "See also" section or equivalent closing reference to `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md` exists.
3. Confirm the recommended cadence (every 5 batches) is mentioned.

**Expected result**: Closing reference to `06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md` exists with cadence note.

---

### Step 5: Verify `docs/workflow/retro-metrics.md` exists and has correct headers

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 7

1. Open `docs/workflow/retro-metrics.md`.
2. Confirm the file exists and has a Markdown table header row.
3. Confirm column names match the six required fields from Step 3d exactly.
4. Confirm no data rows exist (initial state — headers only).

**Expected result**: File exists; table headers present; column names match required fields; no data rows.

---

### Step 6: Verify `06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md` exists and has all required sections

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criteria 4, 5, 6

1. Open `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md`.
2. Confirm the file exists.
3. Confirm the following sections are present: scope resolution (reading the metrics log), trend analysis step, classification step with all three outcomes ("Verified fixed", "Partially fixed", "Still recurring"), escalation step for "Still recurring" items, human-approval gate step, backlog update step.
4. Confirm the default analysis window of 5 entries is documented.
5. Confirm documentation on how to override the window.
6. Confirm the escalation severity for "Still recurring" items is stated as "high".
7. Confirm the protocol states that trend data is directional and the analyst must not overstate confidence.
8. Confirm the constraint that the meta-retrospective must not edit historical entries in `docs/workflow/retro-metrics.md`.

**Expected result**: All required sections present; window default = 5; override documented; "Still recurring" → severity high; directional-only confidence note; no-edit constraint stated.

---

### Step 7: Verify graceful handling of fewer-than-window entries

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 6, 9

1. In `06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md`, locate the scope resolution step (Step 1).
2. Confirm it states that when fewer entries than the window size are available, the analyst uses all available entries and explicitly notes the limited data.
3. Confirm it does not require a minimum of 3 entries (or any minimum) to proceed.

**Expected result**: Protocol permits running with any number of available entries (including 1); limited-data note is required but does not block execution.

---

### Step 8: Verify agent files reference metrics block

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 1 (agent-level enforcement)

1. Open `.claude/agents/retrospective.md`.
2. Confirm it references the metrics block step as part of the retrospective flow.
3. Confirm it references `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md`.
4. Open `.cursor/agents/retrospective.md` and confirm the same additions are present.
5. Open `.codex/skills/workflow-retrospective/SKILL.md` and confirm it references the metrics block and the append-to-log step.

**Expected result**: All three agent/skill files reference the metrics block and meta-retrospective protocol.

---

### Step 9: Verify AGENTS.md and README.md reference meta-retrospective

**Maps to**: Acceptance Criterion 8 (discoverability)

1. Open `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` — they are symlinked).
2. Confirm `06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md` is referenced in the Workflow Commands section.
3. Open `docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md`.
4. Confirm `06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md` is referenced in the Workflow Commands table.

**Expected result**: Both files reference the meta-retrospective protocol in their command reference sections.

### Last Step: Validate & Shut Down

- Verify all assertions in the checklist below are met
- No application to shut down — this is a documentation-only feature

## Known Limitations

- The smoke test is manual; it verifies the presence and correctness of documentation content rather than exercising a running application.
- The accuracy of the metrics block fields (e.g., human interventions count) depends on the analyst's judgment and available GitHub data — this cannot be smoke-tested automatically.
