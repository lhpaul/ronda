# Protocol: Run One Workflow Item

**Agent role**: Work Item Runner (`item-orchestrator`)
**Purpose**: Advance one workflow item, execute the next deterministic action, and keep that item moving until it reaches a real terminal condition

This is a **supporting protocol**. The Work Item Runner does not own a workflow stage, but it coordinates the stage-specific protocols for one development item at a time.

The portfolio-wide launcher is defined separately in `90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` as the **Portfolio Orchestrator** (`orchestrator`).

This protocol may be entered in either of two ways:

- A human invokes the Work Item Runner directly for one specific work item, branch, development folder, or PR
- The Portfolio Orchestrator dispatches the Work Item Runner after scanning the broader portfolio

## Routing From /run-work

`/run-work` with a **single** non-epic target is **not** portfolio scope. The
routing classifier (`run-work-router.sh`, Protocol 96) returns `redirect_item`
with `REDIRECT_COMMAND=/run-item <target>` and performs no mutation. Re-invoke
`/run-item` instead of continuing in Protocol 91 under `/run-work`.

Epic-like single targets return `redirect_epic` with guidance to `/run-epic`.

`/run-item-work` invoked directly (without `/run-work`) is a **deprecated
compatibility alias** for `/run-item` with identical behavior.

See `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/96-run-work-routing-protocol.md`
for the full routing specification.

## Execution Discipline: A Paused Turn Does Not Resume

Read this before running any long step.

**Ending a turn ends this agent. Nothing external wakes it back up.** If the
Work Item Runner starts a long-running step in the background and then ends
its turn to "wait for the completion notification," it parks permanently —
not blocked, not escalated, not dead, just structurally unable to ever observe
its own process finishing. This has happened in production runs: a runner
backgrounded a step, wrote a calm and accurate progress note ("I'll pause here
and wait for the background task notification before continuing"), and ended
its turn. No notification ever reached it, because backgrounded-process
notifications go to whatever *dispatched* the runner (a parent orchestrator or
a human), never back to the runner itself. The item was recovered only because
a supervising parent happened to notice the report named no terminal state.

This is the single most dangerous failure mode for unattended runs, because it
does not look like a failure — the report is plausible, well-written, and (at
the moment it was written) accurate. Nothing distinguishes it from a runner
that is about to continue.

**The rule, for every long-running step this protocol asks the runner to
execute — not only `pr-review-loop.sh` and `pr-ci-loop.sh` (Step 7 / Step 8
restate this rule for those two specifically):**

- Run the step in the foreground and wait for it to finish, in the same turn, or
- If the step must be backgrounded, poll it yourself in the same turn until it
  returns. Capture `pgrep`'s exit code **inside** the loop — do not rely on `$?`
  after `while pgrep ...; do ...; done` (bash sets that to the last body
  command, typically `sleep`, or to `0` if the body never ran — never to
  `pgrep`'s exit status). Use a pattern like:

  <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
  ```bash
  while true; do
    pgrep -f "[p]r-review-loop.sh 1550" >/dev/null
    pgrep_rc=$?
    case $pgrep_rc in
      0) sleep 20 ;;
      1) break ;;  # no match — step ended
      *) break ;;  # 2/3/127 = polling failure
    esac
  done
  # Inspect $pgrep_rc (not $? after the while): 1 = done, proceed to PR state;
  # 2 invalid pattern / 3 fatal / 127 not found = polling failure, not done.
  # Use pgrep_rc, not status — zsh treats status as a read-only special parameter.
  ```

  Make the `pgrep -f` pattern specific enough that it cannot match an unrelated
  process — include the PR number or another identifying argument, and avoid
  matching the polling shell itself (e.g. `pgrep -f "[p]r-review-loop.sh 1550"`,
  not a bare `pgrep -f "pr-review-loop.sh 1550"` whose command line contains the
  same literal and can look eternally alive). A captured `$!` PID plus
  `wait "$pid"` is not available here the way it would be inside a single
  continuous shell script: this runner's tool calls are separate shell
  invocations with no persisted variable state between them, so a PID captured
  when the step is launched is gone by the time a later call checks on it.
  Pattern-matching the running process is the correct mechanism for this
  multi-invocation model, not a workaround for it — keep the pattern specific
  instead of switching to PID capture. Before concluding the step is done,
  inspect the captured `$pgrep_rc`: `1` means no process matched — the step has
  genuinely ended, proceed to read the actual outcome from PR state. Any other
  nonzero status (`2` invalid pattern syntax, `3` fatal error, `127` command
  not found) is a polling failure, not evidence of completion — do not treat it
  as done; report it and check PR state directly instead.
- **Never end a turn while something this runner started is still in flight.**
  A step that takes several minutes (or, for `pr-review-loop.sh`, up to the
  configured `--max-wait`) is expected to take that long — stay with it. Ending
  the turn is not a way to make the wait "free"; it is a way to lose the run.

**Never re-invoke `pr-review-loop.sh` for a PR whose loop is already running.**
The script takes a per-PR single-instance lock; a second concurrent invocation
exits `75` with `REASON=lock_contention` and gives no review information at
all — it will not tell the runner anything about the PR's actual state. If
re-entering this item after a backgrounded or interrupted `pr-review-loop.sh`
run, do not start a new one. Instead, poll for the prior process to finish (or
confirm it is genuinely gone), then read the outcome directly from PR state —
`gh pr view`, the "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" comment, and the GraphQL
review-thread query — rather than launching a duplicate run. Use
`pr-review-loop.sh unlock <pr-number>` only after confirming the recorded lock
PID is no longer alive; it is a stale-lock recovery command, not a way to force
a second run alongside a live one.

## Step 0: Load Effective Guardrails

Before any artifact-mutating action (before creating branches, opening PRs,
updating tracker status, or dispatching stage agents), the Work Item Runner
resolves and reports the **effective guardrails** for this run.

See `docs/workflow/development-workflow/guardrails-enforcement.md` for the
complete resolution rules, the config-field → run-epic-policy mapping table, the
named stop conditions, and the audit-evidence rules. This section summarizes the
in-protocol obligations only.

### Resolution

Resolve the effective guardrails by layering three sources (lowest to highest
priority):

1. Repository configuration — the `guardrails` block in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`.
2. Session overrides — values set earlier in the same conversation.
3. Invocation overrides — flags supplied with the current invocation (e.g.,
   `--delegate-review`, `--may-merge`, `--max-risk`).

When no `guardrails` section is present, apply the conservative defaults: mode
`manual`, no delegated merge, backlog starts confirmation-gated. See section 7
of `guardrails-enforcement.md`.

If the `guardrails` block is present but unreadable or internally contradictory,
stop immediately with the `guardrails_config_unreadable` stop condition before
any mutation. See section 6 of `guardrails-enforcement.md`.

### Report in the Work Item Runner Summary

Before taking any artifact-mutating action, state the following in the run
summary (including in dispatched-subagent handoffs when the Portfolio
Orchestrator resolves guardrails at the portfolio level and passes them down):

- Effective autonomy mode.
- Per-stage open/merge permissions (`may_open_pr`, `may_merge_pr`).
- Per-stage maximum merge risk (`max_merge_risk`).
- Backlog-start policy (`backlog_start.allow_without_confirmation`).
- Configured stop conditions.
- Audit requirements.
- Which values were changed by an invocation or session override (if any).

Before producing any terminal Work Item Runner Summary — ready, done, blocked,
escalated, waiting on human review, waiting on merge, or post-merge cleanup
complete — run the completion self-check and paste its
`## Ground-Truth Completion Verification` section into the summary:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/item-completion-self-check.sh \
  --issue <issue-number> \
  --branch <workflow-branch> \
  --stage <spec|plan|implementation|cleanup> \
  --worktree-path <path-used-for-this-item> \
  [--pr <pr-number>] \
  [--expected-base <base-branch>] \
  [--expected-label ready-for-human-review] \
  [--expected-label ready-for-regression] \
  [--forbid-label needs-fixes] \
  [--require-review-summary true] \
  [--require-review-threads true] \
  [--expected-tracker-status "<status>"]
```

Every claimed surface in the summary must be `verified`, `not_applicable`, or
`unavailable_*` with a reason in that section. Use flags that match the state
being claimed: ready/waiting-on-merge claims include PR readiness labels and
review checks, while blocked/escalated claims omit ready-only labels and instead
show the failing or unavailable surface that justifies the stop. A `discrepancy`
or `unavailable_required` result is non-terminal for a success claim: return to
the matching existing gate instead of reporting success. For blocked or
escalated claims, the same result may be terminal only when the failing row is
the explicit blocker named in the summary and no success state is claimed.

When the Portfolio Orchestrator resolved guardrails at the portfolio level and
passed them into this Work Item Runner handoff, the Work Item Runner inherits
those resolved guardrails rather than re-resolving them independently. Invocation
overrides supplied at the portfolio level flow through to the per-item gates
without re-prompting.

---

## Overview

The Work Item Runner:

1. Resolves the request to exactly one workflow item
2. Determines the next deterministic action for that item
3. Executes creator, review-gate, PR, CI, and automated-review work as one continuous control loop
4. Stops only when the item is truly waiting on a human, blocked, or escalated

### Bounded prelude (read-only gate)

When invoked through **`/run-item`** or the `/run-item-work` compatibility alias
with bounded scope flags, run the shared bounded prelude **before** any artifact
mutation in Step 1 or later:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/run-bounded-prelude.sh \
  --original-command "<invocation>" \
  <scope flags> \
  [--delegate-review ...] \
  --json
```

See [`bounded-run-prelude.md`](../bounded-run-prelude.md).

**Always-confirm**: `policyRecommendation.requiresConfirmation` is always `true`.
The orchestrator must print `policyRecommendation.confirmationSummary` before
any mutation. The summary is the operator-facing contract for scope, effective
policy, field sources, pending checkpoints, copy-paste equivalent, and the
read-only guarantee.

When the human confirms the summary, or when all required autonomy flags are
explicit and no unresolved checkpoint or guardrail conflict blocks mutation,
record the invocation-scoped binding before continuing:

- `RUN_ITEM_POLICY_CONFIRMED=true`
- `RUN_ITEM_POLICY_CONFIRMED_ITEM=<resolved item identifier>`
- `RUN_ITEM_POLICY_CONFIRMED_POLICY=<normalized selected policy>`

The normalized policy must include at least backlog-start authority, delegated
review, merge authority, max risk, base branch, and checkpoint count. This
binding prevents redundant prompts only while the runner remains on the same
resolved item with the same selected policy.

- When all autonomy flags (`--delegate-review`, `--may-merge`, `--may-start-backlog`,
  `--max-risk`) were provided explicitly in the invocation, those explicit flags
  serve as the human's confirmation — proceed immediately after printing the summary
  and recording the invocation-scoped binding.
- When any flag was inferred from scope, scope is ambiguous, or pending checkpoints
  remain, stop before mutation and ask the human to confirm or re-invoke with
  corrected flags.
- When guardrails cannot be read (`guardrails_config_unreadable`), stop before
  mutation per `guardrails-enforcement.md`.

**Portfolio batch dispatch (`BATCH_CONTEXT=true`)**: When the Portfolio
Orchestrator dispatches this protocol from Protocol 90, the bounded prelude is
**not** re-run per item — batch approval in Protocol 90 Step 2 covers tracker
mutation and human confirmation before dispatch. Operators who need per-item
policy confirmation must invoke **`/run-item`** directly (which runs the prelude)
rather than relying on portfolio batch dispatch alone.

### Persistent orchestration contract

A single Work Item Runner run should keep advancing the selected item until it reaches one of these **terminal conditions**:

- A PR is clean and waiting for human review / merge because delegated merge
  authority is absent, blocked, or denied for this stage
- A delegated merge was permitted and completed, with branch cleanup and live
  tracker verification complete
- A human product or architecture decision is required
- The automated review loop or CI loop escalated after retry / timeout limits
- The item is blocked by an unmet dependency
- The request cannot be resolved to exactly one workflow item

These are **not** terminal conditions and must not stop the run:

- A creator stage finished drafting its output
- A reviewer found fixable PR feedback
- A branch was pushed and still needs a PR opened
- A PR is open but still waiting for CI or automated review to finish
- Automated review found blocking PR feedback that the matching fixer agent can address

For sweep, batch, helper-extraction, numeric-target, or pattern-completeness
items, `ready-for-human-review` is also non-terminal until
`scripts/development-workflow/scope-residual-gate.sh` has produced `RESULT=pass`
or `RESULT=not_applicable`. `RESULT=block` keeps the item in fixes, and
`RESULT=escalate` is a named human-decision stop.

---

## Step 1: Resolve the Target Item

When an issue tracker is configured in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`, **always query the tracker first** to get the item's current status before relying on VCS state. If the tracker is unavailable (API unreachable, no MCP server), **you MUST immediately warn the human** that status is being inferred from VCS and may be stale — do not silently proceed.

Prefer the helper scripts in `scripts/development-workflow/` for deterministic state inspection before falling back to ad hoc shell commands.

### Batch context indicator

**Check for batch context**: If this Work Item Runner was dispatched as part of
an explicit-list batch by the Portfolio Orchestrator
(`90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`), including sequential fallback, the
handoff metadata will indicate `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`. Note this indicator; you
will use it in Step 3 (Dispatch Strategy) to decide whether worktree isolation
is required.

When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` and the runner may mutate artifacts, the handoff must
also include the Portfolio Orchestrator's isolation assignment: expected
worktree path, expected workflow branch, artifact repo root, approved base
branch, mutation classification, and `isolation: "worktree"`. Missing isolation
metadata is non-terminal for direct single-item runs, but in mutating batch
dispatch it is a dispatch error: stop before mutation and report the missing
field to the Portfolio Orchestrator. This isolation check complements, but does
not replace, the #1200 nested artifact guard for duplicate or wrong-base PR
artifacts.

**CHANGELOG in parallel batches**: Each item in a parallel batch adds its own
`changelog.d/` fragment as normal. Do not skip or consolidate release notes;
the release workflow assembles pending fragments into `CHANGELOG.md` — see
protocol 90 Step 3.6 for rationale.

### Explicit Item List Scope Guard

**Hard-refuse rule**: When the Work Item Runner is dispatched with an explicit item list (e.g., `ITEM_LIST=143,148,145` in handoff metadata, or a direct human invocation like `/run-item-work 143 148 145`), it **must not** take any artifact-mutating action on items outside that list. This rule applies to **all** of the following artifact mutations:

- Branch creation
- PR opening, labeling, or editing
- Tracker status updates
- Stage-agent dispatch
- changelog fragment edits

**Detection**: An explicit item list is present when the handoff metadata or human invocation includes a bounded set of issue numbers, tracker IDs, branch names, or PR numbers. A single-item invocation targeting one specific item is self-scoping and does not require a list check beyond confirming that any encountered open PR or branch belongs to the same item.

**Out-of-scope item detection**: During Step 1 (resolve), Step 2 (determine next action), and at any point during execution, if the Work Item Runner encounters any open PR, branch, or tracker item that is **not** in the explicit list:

1. **Do not touch it** — skip all artifact mutations for that item.
2. **Log a WARNING** (do not silently skip):

   ```text
   WARNING: out-of-scope item detected — [branch/PR/issue identifier] is not in the explicit item list [<list>]. Skipping all actions for this item.
   ```

3. Include all detected out-of-scope items in the Step 6 summary under a dedicated "Out-of-Scope Items Detected (Skipped)" section.

**Corollary — no opportunistic advancement**: When an explicit list is active, the Work Item Runner must not opportunistically advance an out-of-scope item even if it appears clearly ready or related. Every such item gets the WARNING log and is skipped.

**Human override**: An explicit human instruction within the same session may expand the scope. The override must be stated explicitly. Log the override in the Step 6 summary.

Resolve the request to exactly one of the following:

1. **Backlog / tracker work item** — use when a human explicitly requests a not-yet-started item
2. **Development folder** — `docs/specs/developments/<timestamp>_<slug>`
3. **Workflow branch** — `spec/*`, `implementation-plan/*`, `feature/*`, `refactor/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*`
4. **Open PR**

Use these helpers while resolving and resuming work:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --development <path>
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --branch <branch>
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --pr <number>
```

If the request is portfolio-wide or refers to multiple items, stop using this protocol and switch to `90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`.

Important for `development folder` targets:

- `workflow-next-action.sh --development` is only reliable once the item is already `Spec Ready`, `Plan Ready`, or `In Development`.
- The script uses a VCS-level merged-PR check to distinguish `Plan Ready` (not yet started) from `Done` (branch merged and cleaned up). This is tracker-agnostic and requires only `gh`.
- The script **cannot** distinguish `Spec in Review` / `Plan in Review` from the corresponding merged state. If the target may still be waiting on a spec or plan PR merge, confirm the state via the issue tracker or by inspecting the workflow branch / PR directly before advancing.
- If `NEXT_ACTION=skip` is returned, the item is already done — do not redispatch.

When dispatching a subagent for this item, include a short "Tracker Work Item Summary" in the handoff:

- What the work item is asking for
- Any scope changes / decisions in recent comments
- Any ambiguity or conflict that still requires human confirmation

When dispatching any plan-writing work, include the exact current invocation
item list (the single item for `/run-item`, or the current-batch item list for
`/run-items`) and any same-surface open PR evidence provided by the parent
orchestrator. "Same-surface" means an open PR whose changed workflow surface
plausibly affects the same operational assumption; shared issue keywords alone
are not same-surface evidence. The planner uses this bounded context for the
`Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check`; it must not widen scope or scan
every open PR. If the planner reports `Conflict` evidence for the same
operational assumption surface, stop plan-stage advancement with
`unclear_requirements` until the parent records `Resolved` or the human
supplies a decision.

When advancing a `Plan Ready` item into implementation, read the plan's
`Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check`. Applicable assumptions are handed
to the implementer for fresh source verification before file edits. A
`Still valid` result may proceed. A changed, conflicting, or unverifiable result
is `Stale or conflicting` and returns to the parent orchestrator before
mutation.

> **Integration-branch note**: When the item carries an `integration-branch:<slug>` label, the plan PR targets `develop-<slug>` instead of `develop`. The ordering gate (spec PR merged before plan PR) still applies, but to `develop-<slug>` not `develop`.

For GitHub Projects, the project **Type** field is authoritative for Backlog
route classification. Repository labels such as `workflow`, `bug`,
`enhancement`, and `type:*` are legacy classification hints only; do not rely on
them when Type is available.

### Spec-dispatch relationship context gate

Before a direct single-item run transitions a Backlog item into **Writing Spec**,
run or consume the spec-dispatch context helper:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/spec-dispatch-context.sh \
  --selected <issue-number> \
  --items <selected-and-in-scope-backlog-peer-issue-numbers> \
  [--confirmed-decision-file <jsonl-file>] \
  --json
```

When the item is dispatched by Protocol 90, use the handoff-provided context
instead of recomputing it unless the handoff is missing or stale. When running
directly, populate `--items` with the selected item plus the relevant in-scope
Backlog peers from the current tracker scan so keyword-overlap relationships can
be classified on the single-item path. If no peer scope is available, the helper
still collects human-confirmed decisions from the issue and optional
current-session decision file, but peer relationship classification is skipped.

If helper output has `blocking=true`, stop before tracker mutation, branch
creation, or spec-writer dispatch and report the `humanAction`. If it is not
blocking, pass `confirmedDecisions[]` and `relationships[]` to
`01-generate-spec-protocol.md`. Shared terminology alone must not be treated as
a dependency; `Dependent` requires concrete evidence, `Orthogonal` means no
ordering dependency, and `Unclear` requires a human relationship decision.

### Fast Track blast-radius gate (mandatory before fast-track dispatch)

**When to run**: Before classifying a backlog item as Fast Track and dispatching it to `03-implement-development-protocol.md` Path 3, run this gate. It applies to any item whose tracker Type, issue metadata, or brief suggests a bug fix or simple change (i.e., not a feature requiring a spec).

**What to check**:

1. Inspect the issue title, body, recent comments, and any linked spec or plan document for concrete signals that the change spans more than one architectural layer simultaneously. Examples of multi-layer signals:
   - Issue body mentions two or more of: database schema, API endpoint, UI component, data pipeline, storage, mapper, presentation layer.
   - Issue body or a linked spec/plan describes coordinating changes across distinct subsystems (e.g., "update the model, the API, and the UI").
   - Any linked spec or plan document covers more than one architectural layer.
2. Identify the primary entity being renamed or modified when the brief or linked artifact makes one identifiable. The entity may be a field, type, function, workflow variable, API contract key, or similar named surface.
3. When a primary entity is identifiable, run a bounded repository search over non-test source references before Fast Track dispatch. Count both affected files and occurrences. Treat this as a planning-risk signal; it does not need to prove every reference requires a code edit.
4. Check whether the item affects live external system configuration or integration contracts that repository search may not expose, including workflow automation, third-party API schemas, sibling repositories, or similar external config.

**Non-test source scope**: Count source, config, and workflow files that are not tests, specs, fixtures, generated artifacts, lockfiles, documentation, or changelog entries. Example searches may use `rg`, `grep`, IDE search, or an equivalent repository search; do not add a custom parser or script dependency for this MVP.

**High call-site volume threshold**: Treat the entity as high volume when either more than 15 non-test source files or more than 30 non-test source occurrences reference it.

**Decision rule (deterministic)**:

- **No concrete multi-layer signal, external-system result is no signal found, primary-entity ambiguity does not block a defensible routing decision, and either no high call-site volume for an identifiable primary entity or an explicit human override for high call-site volume is recorded** → the item may proceed as Fast Track.
- **At least one concrete multi-layer signal found** → the item must NOT be fast-tracked. Route it to the Full Pipeline (spec → plan → implement) so all layers are planned and coordinated. Update the tracker status to **Writing Spec** and dispatch `01-generate-spec-protocol.md`.
- **High call-site volume found without explicit human override** → the item must NOT be fast-tracked. Route it to the Full Pipeline and include a visible note such as: "High call-site volume detected: N files / M occurrences; routing to Full Pipeline so scope can be audited before implementation."
- **Primary entity is ambiguous** → record why the call-site check is not applicable, or ask for clarification when the ambiguity prevents a defensible Fast Track decision.
- **Known or likely external-system impact found** → do not proceed as immediate Fast Track work. Route to the Full Pipeline, or require a tracked pre-flight follow-up before any later Fast Track dispatch.
- **External-system clarification required** → stop before Fast Track dispatch and ask the human for the missing context, or route to the Full Pipeline if the uncertainty is material enough that implementation would require guessing.

**Routing evidence**: The Work Item Runner summary must record the cross-layer result, the primary entity and call-site result when applicable, and the external-system impact result. For external-system impact, record one of: no signal found, signal found, or clarification required.

This gate is additive: cross-layer scope checks architectural spread, while call-site volume checks propagation breadth regardless of layer count. A positive signal from either check is enough to disqualify Fast Track. A vague or general description is not a multi-layer signal; at least one concrete signal where the issue or linked document text explicitly mentions two or more distinct architectural layers is required for the cross-layer branch of the gate.

### Pre-dispatch tracker status update (single-item path)

When the Work Item Runner is invoked **directly** (not via Protocol 90) and the item's tracker status is stale — for example, a Refactor item is still `Backlog` even though the plan is merged and implementation is about to start — the runner must update the tracker status **before** dispatching the creator agent. Use the same transition table as Protocol 90 Step 2.5:

| Next action to dispatch                                                                       | Tracker status to set |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Write Spec                                                                                    | `Writing Spec`        |
| Write Plan                                                                                    | `Writing Plan`        |
| Implement (feature/fix/refactor/hotfix branch)                                                | `In Development`      |
| Resume in-progress stage (status already `Writing Spec`, `Writing Plan`, or `In Development`) | No change — skip      |

This mirrors what Protocol 90 does at the portfolio level in Step 2.5 and ensures the tracker reflects the correct in-flight state regardless of whether the item was dispatched by the Portfolio Orchestrator or invoked directly by a human.

If the tracker is unavailable, log a warning and proceed — do not block advancement.

### Stale `In Development` pre-dispatch check (AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-10)

**Scope** (BR-7): This check applies **only** when the Work Item Runner was dispatched from the Portfolio Orchestrator (i.e., `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` is present in the handoff metadata). A direct human invocation of `item-orchestrator` will encounter an "In Development" status and should prompt the human for confirmation rather than automatically resetting the tracker — the human may intentionally be resuming in-progress work. When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` is not set, skip this sub-step.

**When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`**: If the item's tracker status is exactly `In Development` at this point in Step 2, run the following check before dispatching:

1. **Guard — skip if issue number is invalid**: Before running the branch and PR checks, verify that `ISSUE_NUMBER` is a non-empty positive integer. GitHub issue numbers are always positive integers; a non-integer value indicates a data problem and would cause `git ls-remote` to search for unintended patterns. If invalid, set `HAS_BRANCH` and `HAS_PR` to `1` to force the "genuinely in progress" outcome (step 4) and skip the network checks entirely:

   ```bash
   if ! echo "${ISSUE_NUMBER:-}" | grep -qE '^[1-9][0-9]*$'; then
     echo "WARNING: invalid ISSUE_NUMBER '${ISSUE_NUMBER:-}' — skipping stale detection; treating item as genuinely in progress."
     HAS_BRANCH=1  # force "genuinely in progress" — skip network checks below
     HAS_PR=1
   fi
   ```

2. **Check for an existing implementation branch or open PR** (skip if guard above set `HAS_BRANCH=1`):

   ```bash
   # Only check implementation-stage branches (feature/fix/refactor/hotfix).
   # spec/* and implementation-plan/* branches persist on the remote after merge
   # and must not be treated as evidence that implementation is active.
   # git ls-remote uses bare-number forms only (feature/123-slug, feature/123).
   # Tracker-prefixed forms (feature/ENG-123-slug) are detected by the more-precise
   # gh pr list regex below; broad globs like *-123-* false-positive on unrelated
   # branches containing the issue number in their slug (e.g. feature/456-add-123-logs).
   # Use pipefail so a network/auth failure propagates; on failure, skip stale
   # detection and treat the item as genuinely in progress (fail-open).
   # Only run if the guard above did not already set HAS_BRANCH/HAS_PR=1.
   if [ "${HAS_BRANCH:-0}" -eq 0 ] && [ "${HAS_PR:-0}" -eq 0 ]; then
     HAS_BRANCH=$(set -o pipefail; git ls-remote origin \
       "refs/heads/feature/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*" \
       "refs/heads/feature/${ISSUE_NUMBER}" \
       "refs/heads/fix/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*" \
       "refs/heads/fix/${ISSUE_NUMBER}" \
       "refs/heads/refactor/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*" \
       "refs/heads/refactor/${ISSUE_NUMBER}" \
       "refs/heads/hotfix/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*" \
       "refs/heads/hotfix/${ISSUE_NUMBER}" \
       2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') || {
       echo "WARNING: git ls-remote failed for issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER} — skipping stale detection."
       HAS_BRANCH=1  # treat as genuinely in progress
     }

     # The jq regex includes an optional tracker-prefix group ([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-)
     # to match both feature/123-slug and feature/ENG-123-slug forms.
     # Do NOT use || echo 0: a gh failure must not be interpreted as "no PR exists".
     # On failure, treat as genuinely in progress (fail-open).
     HAS_PR=$(gh pr list --state open --limit 1000 \
       --json number,headRefName \
       --jq "[.[] | select(.headRefName | test(\"^(feature|fix|refactor|hotfix)/([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-)?${ISSUE_NUMBER}(-|\$)\"))] | length" \
       2>/dev/null) || {
       echo "WARNING: gh pr list failed for issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER} — skipping stale detection."
       HAS_PR=1  # treat as genuinely in progress
     }
   fi
   ```

3. **If both checks return zero** (no branch, no PR): the "In Development" status is stale (BR-5). Apply the correction:
   - Log a `STALE_STATUS_CORRECTION:` line:

     ```text
     STALE_STATUS_CORRECTION: issue #<N> tracker shows 'In Development' but no branch or PR found. Correcting to 'Plan Ready'.
     ```

   - Update the tracker status to `Plan Ready` using `update_tracker_status_best_effort` (BR-6).

   - Continue dispatching the implementation stage as if the item was `Plan Ready` (the pre-dispatch tracker status update, which ran earlier in this step and was a no-op because the status was already "In Development", will re-run for the corrected dispatch and advance the tracker back to `In Development`). The brief "Plan Ready" state between the stale reset and the new dispatch is intentional and transient — the orchestrator runs sequentially, so no concurrent observer will act on this intermediate value.

4. **If either check returns non-zero** (branch or PR found): the item is genuinely in progress — do not reset the status. Before reusing a branch, complete the branch-reuse validation gate below. Only a `compatible` result may reach `workflow-next-action.sh` (AC-8).

### Pre-dispatch branch check

Before dispatching any creator-stage agent, run all three checks below. An
existing branch or active worktree means work may already exist, but a matching
item identifier alone does not authorize reuse.

```bash
git branch -r | grep "<branch-prefix>/<slug>"
git branch | grep "<branch-prefix>/<slug>"
git worktree list | grep "<branch-prefix>/<slug>"
```

| Stage about to dispatch | Branch / worktree to check for |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Write spec              | `spec/[slug]`                  |
| Write plan              | `implementation-plan/[slug]`   |
| Implement (Feature)     | `feature/[slug]`               |
| Implement (Refactor)    | `refactor/[slug]`              |

If any check returns a match, record the exact candidate and **do not
re-dispatch yet**. Continue through the nested-artifact guard and branch-reuse
validation gate below before calling `workflow-next-action.sh`.

### Nested artifact guard before child dispatch

Before dispatching any creator-stage or PR-opening child agent for an item with
a positive numeric issue number, run:

```bash
ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT="${ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT:-$(pwd)}"
./scripts/development-workflow/run-nested-artifact-guard.sh \
  --mode pre-create \
  --issue "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
  --expected-branch "<branch-prefix>/<slug>" \
  --approved-base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
  --repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT"
```

Run the same helper with `--mode pre-pr` before any stage agent opens a PR. The
approved base must come from the bounded prelude, portfolio handoff, integration
branch resolution, or explicit human override. Treat `RESULT=missing_base`,
`RESULT=blocked_duplicate`, `RESULT=wrong_base`, and `RESULT=scan_failed` as
non-terminal blockers; resume the canonical path or obtain explicit split
approval before continuing. Add `--expected-worktree <path>` only when a
non-empty expected worktree path is known.

Set `ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT` to the repository that owns the branch and PR being
guarded. In `workflow_hub` mode, implementation artifacts live in the selected
product checkout, not the hub checkout; hub-owned spec and plan artifacts keep
using the hub repository root.

The guard validates the expected workflow branch name before it scans artifacts.
Use bare numeric identifiers such as feature/1858-safe-name, never
feature/#1858-safe-name; it rejects unsafe characters before creation or PR
readiness can continue.

### Existing-branch reuse validation

After candidate discovery and a clean nested-artifact guard, validate the exact
expected branch against the run's approved base:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/validate-branch-reuse.sh \
  --issue "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
  --branch "<branch-prefix>/<slug>" \
  --approved-base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
  --repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT" \
  --json
```

The helper is read-only and does not fetch or mutate refs. Callers must refresh
required refs before invoking it. It applies the same workflow branch-name
validation before checking Git ref syntax or ancestry. Route its structured
`RESULT` as follows:

| Result | Required next action |
| --- | --- |
| `no_existing_branch` | Continue the fresh-branch path only when discovery also found no candidate. If a previously discovered candidate disappeared, stop as `reuse_verification_blocked`. |
| `compatible` | Report the resolved base/candidate refs and tips, keep tracking divergence as separate diagnostic evidence, and resume with `workflow-next-action.sh --branch <branch>`. |
| `incompatible` | Stop as `incompatible_reuse_blocked` before creator dispatch, file/Git mutation, PR/label mutation, or tracker mutation. Name the item, branch, approved base, failed ancestry evidence, and the helper's `HUMAN_ACTION`. |
| `verification_blocked` | Stop as `reuse_verification_blocked` before mutation. Name the unavailable or ambiguous evidence and the helper's `HUMAN_ACTION`; do not report it as confirmed incompatibility. |

Only positive evidence from
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <approved-base-tip> <candidate-tip>` authorizes
reuse. Local-versus-remote ahead/behind counts are diagnostic and never replace
the approved-base decision. The runner must not automatically delete, reset,
rebase, check out, force-push, or otherwise rewrite an incompatible or
unverifiable branch. Any destructive cleanup or different recovery path
requires a separate explicit human decision.

If a spec, plan, implementation, or review-fix update would rewrite a published
workflow PR branch, stop before mutation and run
`scripts/development-workflow/workflow-branch-push-guard.sh`. Only the guard may
execute an authorized destructive PR branch update, and only after matching
trusted, single-use human authorization for the exact repository, PR, full
branch ref, action, operator, expected remote tip, and authorized new tip from
a separate GitHub `User` with repository `admin` permission. The executing
credential cannot self-authorize.

Record one of `fresh_branch`, `compatible_reuse`,
`incompatible_reuse_blocked`, or `reuse_verification_blocked` in the Work Item
Runner summary.

### Integration-branch base override (sub-items with `integration-branch:<slug>` label)

Before dispatching any creator-stage agent, check whether the item carries an `integration-branch:<slug>` label:

```bash
gh issue view <issue-number> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name | select(startswith("integration-branch:"))'
```

If the label is present:

1. **Derive the integration branch name**: `develop-<slug>` (replace `<slug>` with the value after `integration-branch:`).
   When the bounded prelude or portfolio handoff already resolved
   `BASE_BRANCH=develop` because the label was partial, mixed, missing on the
   remote, or unverifiable, do not re-adopt `develop-<slug>` silently. Preserve
   the approved base and report the prelude warning before mutation.
2. **Resolve the branch owner**. In `single_repo`, the integration branch is
   owned by the current repository. In `workflow_hub`, it is the product
   implementation base and must be checked against the selected product
   repository, not the hub repository. Hub-owned spec and plan artifacts still
   target the hub artifact base branch.
3. **Verify the branch exists on the owning remote** using
   `git ls-remote --exit-code --heads`. Exit `0` means the branch exists, exit
   `2` means it is missing, and any other non-zero status means validation
   failed:

   ```bash
   OWNING_REPO_ROOT="<current-or-selected-product-repository-root>"
   OWNING_REMOTE="origin"
   set +e
   git -C "$OWNING_REPO_ROOT" ls-remote --exit-code --heads "$OWNING_REMOTE" "develop-<slug>" >/dev/null 2>&1
   BRANCH_STATUS=$?
   set -e
   if [ "$BRANCH_STATUS" -ne 0 ] && [ "$BRANCH_STATUS" -ne 2 ]; then
     echo "WARNING: failed to verify whether develop-<slug> exists on the owning remote; skipping auto-create for this item."
     continue  # or return 1 / exit 1 depending on surrounding loop/function context
   fi
   ```

4. **If the branch does not exist** (`BRANCH_STATUS` is `2`), create and push it
   from the owning repository's default implementation branch:

	   ```bash
	   set -euo pipefail
	   OWNING_REPO_ROOT="<current-or-selected-product-repository-root>"
	   OWNING_REMOTE="origin"
	   DEFAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_BRANCH="<default-implementation-branch>"
   git -C "$OWNING_REPO_ROOT" fetch "$OWNING_REMOTE" "$DEFAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_BRANCH"
   git -C "$OWNING_REPO_ROOT" checkout -B develop-<slug> "$OWNING_REMOTE/$DEFAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_BRANCH"
   git -C "$OWNING_REPO_ROOT" push -u "$OWNING_REMOTE" develop-<slug>
   git -C "$OWNING_REPO_ROOT" switch "$DEFAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_BRANCH"
   ```

   Log: `INFO: created integration branch develop-<slug> from origin/<default-implementation-branch> for sub-item #<issue-number>.`

5. **Record the implementation base branch**: store `BASE_BRANCH=develop-<slug>`
   and pass it to stage-agent dispatch metadata. In `single_repo`, spec, plan,
   implementation, fix, and refactor PRs target `develop-<slug>`. In
   `workflow_hub`, only product implementation, fix, refactor, review, CI, merge,
   and cleanup actions use `develop-<slug>` in the selected product repository;
   hub-owned spec and plan PRs target the hub artifact base branch.

**Single-item exemption**: When the item carries no `integration-branch:*` label, skip this check. The default base branch (`develop`) applies.

### Repository-mode context declaration

Before any mutation-oriented action, resolve and state repository ownership:

- `WORKFLOW_MODE`
- artifact owner for the current stage
- selected product repository name when implementation work is product-owned
- local path or remote identity when available
- mutation target for file edits, branch creation, commits, PR creation,
  reviewer-loop execution, CI polling, and cleanup
- base branch validation target

Missing mode or explicit `single_repo` keeps the current repository as the owner
and does not require `--repo`. In `workflow_hub`, specs and plans remain
hub-owned unless a future contract says otherwise. Product implementation work
must target the selected product repository. If the selected product repository
is missing or ambiguous, stop before file mutation, branch creation, commit, or
implementation PR creation.

In `workflow_hub`, do not validate a product execution base such as `develop`
against the hub repository before product repository selection. Hub-owned spec
and plan branches use the hub artifact base branch, typically the hub
repository default branch. Product implementation branches use the selected
product repository checkout and that product repository's resolved base branch
(`BASE_BRANCH` from the run-epic scope when present, otherwise the product
entry's `default_branch`).

### Spec-Plan ordering gate

**The plan PR must never be opened before the spec PR has been merged to the integration branch.**

This gate applies whenever the spec and plan are written in the same agent run (i.e., the Work Item Runner advances from spec to plan writing without a human merge in between). The root cause is that reviewers check for the spec file on the target branch — if the spec is only on an unmerged spec branch, the plan PR fails review with "spec file not present on branch."

**Rule: when spec writing and plan writing happen in the same run:**

1. Write the plan content locally on the plan branch (the plan may be written proactively, but it must not be pushed or a PR opened yet).
2. Open the spec PR and advance it to `ready-for-human-review` following the full PR readiness chain (Step 7a, Step 7, Step 8).
3. Resolve `EXPECTED_SPEC_BASE`: in `workflow_hub`, use the hub artifact base
   branch; otherwise use `BASE_BRANCH` when present, falling back to `develop`.
4. Stop and report to the orchestrator with the following structured message:

   > Spec PR #N is `ready-for-human-review`. Plan is written and staged locally on branch `implementation-plan/<slug>`, but the plan PR will not be opened until the spec PR is confirmed merged to `<expected-spec-base>`. On the next dispatch (after spec merge is confirmed), push the plan branch and open the plan PR.

5. On the next dispatch (after spec merge is confirmed via `gh pr view <spec_pr> --json state` returning `MERGED`), push the plan branch and open the plan PR. The plan content was written in the prior run; do not regenerate it.

**Verification before opening a plan PR:**

Before calling `gh pr create` for any `implementation-plan/*` branch, confirm the spec PR is merged:

```bash
# Check whether the spec PR is merged into the expected base branch.
# EXPECTED_SPEC_BASE is the hub artifact base in workflow_hub mode; otherwise it
# is "develop" by default, or "develop-<slug>" when integration-branch:<slug> is present.
# Substitute <spec_pr_number> and <expected-base> with actual values before running:
gh pr view <spec_pr_number> --json state,baseRefName \
  --jq 'select(.state=="MERGED" and .baseRefName=="<expected-spec-base>") | "OK"'
# Expected output: OK
# If no output: the spec PR is not merged into the expected base branch — do not open the plan PR
```

If the spec PR is still `OPEN`, apply the ordering gate above and stop. If the spec PR is `CLOSED` (rejected without merge), do **not** open the plan PR and do **not** apply the ordering gate — escalate to the human, because the spec was rejected and the plan cannot proceed without a merged spec.

**Exception — Refactor items (no spec):** Items following the Refactor path (`02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` without a preceding spec step) are exempt from this gate. There is no spec PR to wait for.

(When the item carries an `integration-branch:<slug>` label in `single_repo`,
"spec PR merged to the integration branch" means merged to `develop-<slug>`, not
to `develop`. In `workflow_hub`, hub-owned spec and plan PRs use the hub
artifact base instead, even when product implementation work uses
`develop-<slug>`.)

### Dependency check

Before advancing the item, check its spec's `Depends on` field. If any dependency is not yet `Merged` or `Released`, stop and report the blocked state to the human.

### Checkpoint-Resume Gate

When resuming an item after a human-checkpoint pause, and the prior run used a
dedicated item worktree, run the checkpoint-resume gate **before any
mutation** (file edit, branch switch, commit, PR update, label update, tracker
write, or merge). This closes the resume-side gap where a SendMessage or new
session starts from the main clone instead of the item's isolated worktree.

Use the executable fail-closed gate before any resumed-session mutation:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/checkpoint-resume-gate.sh \
  --item <item-id> \
  --expected-branch <branch-prefix>/<slug> \
  --expected-worktree <worktree-path> \
  --main-repo-root <main-repo-root> \
  --checkpoint-state <pending|satisfied|waived> \
  --json
```

The gate invokes the read-only worktree preflight to inspect current CWD,
current branch, and `git worktree list --porcelain`. It must not change CWD,
switch branches, create/delete worktrees, edit files, commit, push, update
tracker state, update PRs, apply labels, merge PRs, or satisfy/waive any human
checkpoint.

Handle gate results as follows:

| Result | Meaning | Required action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESULT=continue` | Current CWD is already inside the expected worktree on the expected branch. | Continue the item run from the current directory. |
| `RESULT=checkpoint_pending` | Isolation is valid but the human checkpoint remains pending. | Stop for the required human decision. |
| `RESULT=stop` | Context is missing, ambiguous, detached, wrong-branch, or starts in the main clone. | Stop before mutation; start a fresh runner with the complete assignment. |

Stop output must include: item, expected branch, expected worktree when known,
target worktree when found, observed directory, observed branch when available,
failure reason, and human recovery action.

Isolation verification never satisfies, waives, clears, or otherwise modifies a
human checkpoint. A main-clone resume must stop; it must not change directory,
switch branches, or repair state automatically.

When resuming after an interrupted mutating run, inspect the item branch
history, local worktree commits, and uncommitted edits before making a new
mutation. Prefer the latest committed checkpoint that represents a completed
logical sub-part as the resume boundary. Absence of a newer checkpoint is
acceptable evidence that no completed sub-part finished after the last
checkpoint, but live branch, PR, worktree, review, CI, and tracker state still
control the next action.

---

## Step 3: Dispatch Strategy

Use the matching workflow agent / skill for the next stage when your runner supports handoff. Otherwise continue in the current session by following the referenced stage protocol directly.

**Subagent assignment by stage:**

| Stage action                | Preferred execution path                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write spec                  | `product-manager`                                                                                                                       |
| Review spec                 | Native review against `REVIEW.md` or the compatibility wrapper `01-review-spec-protocol.md`                                             |
| Write plan                  | `tech-lead`                                                                                                                             |
| Review plan                 | Native review against `REVIEW.md` or the compatibility wrapper `02-review-implementation-plan-protocol.md`                              |
| Implement feature           | `developer`                                                                                                                             |
| Review code (post-draft-PR) | `code-reviewer` agent (Claude Code: `/code-review`); for other runners use compatibility wrapper `03-review-implementation-protocol.md` |

### Worktree isolation for batch dispatch

**When dispatched as part of an explicit-list batch** (`BATCH_CONTEXT=true` in the handoff metadata):

1. If the handoff explicitly classifies the runner as `read_only`, do not create
   a dedicated worktree and do not mutate files, switch branches, commit, push,
   mutate PRs, change labels, or update tracker state. If a mutating action
   becomes necessary, stop and return to the Portfolio Orchestrator so the item
   can be redispatched as `mutating` with a Protocol 90 isolation manifest
   assignment.

2. **For mutating runners, create a dedicated worktree** for this item before executing any stage work. This ensures complete isolation from other Work Item Runners in the batch, including sequential fallback where the same batch contract is preserved.

3. Determine the appropriate base branch for the worktree:

   **If `BASE_BRANCH` is present in the handoff metadata** (set by the
   Portfolio Orchestrator when the item carries an `integration-branch:<slug>`
   label or by run-epic policy), use `origin/<BASE_BRANCH>` as the base for
   product implementation, fix, and refactor worktrees except for `hotfix/*`.
   In `workflow_hub`, this branch must be checked in the selected product
   repository, not in the hub repository. Hub-owned `spec/*` and
   `implementation-plan/*` worktrees ignore the product `BASE_BRANCH` and use
   `origin/<hub-artifact-base-branch>` instead.

   **If `BASE_BRANCH` is absent**, use the default table:

| Item type                     | Base branch      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Feature (`feature/`)          | `origin/<product-default-branch>` in `workflow_hub`, otherwise `origin/develop` |
| Refactor (`refactor/`)        | `origin/<product-default-branch>` in `workflow_hub`, otherwise `origin/develop` |
| Fast Track fix (`fix/`)       | `origin/<product-default-branch>` in `workflow_hub`, otherwise `origin/develop` |
| Hotfix (`hotfix/`)            | `origin/main`    |
| Spec (`spec/`)                | `origin/<hub-artifact-base-branch>` in `workflow_hub`, otherwise `origin/develop` |
| Plan (`implementation-plan/`) | `origin/<hub-artifact-base-branch>` in `workflow_hub`, otherwise `origin/develop` |

**Note:** Use `origin/<base>` (remote tracking) rather than local `<base>` to avoid git worktree conflicts if the local base branch is already checked out elsewhere.

4. Create the worktree at the worktree path assigned by the Protocol 90
   isolation manifest. Do not invent, shorten, or substitute a different
   `<worktree-path>` for a mutating batch dispatch. If `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`,
   the runner may mutate artifacts, and the manifest-assigned absolute worktree
   path is missing, stop before creating a worktree or mutating files and report
   the missing assignment to the Portfolio Orchestrator. The command depends on
   whether the item's branch already exists:

```bash
# Fetch latest remote refs first
git fetch origin

# Case A: New item — branch does not exist yet
# <worktree-path> must be the manifest-assigned absolute path.
git worktree add <worktree-path> -b <branch-prefix>/<slug> origin/<base-branch>

# Case B: Resuming item — branch exists locally
git worktree add <worktree-path> <branch-prefix>/<slug>

# Case C: Resuming item — branch exists only on remote
git worktree add <worktree-path> -b <branch-prefix>/<slug> origin/<branch-prefix>/<slug>

cd <worktree-path>
```

Use the pre-dispatch branch check from Step 2 (`git branch --list`, `git branch -r --list`) to determine which case applies. Case B and C are common when resuming "In Development" items, PRs with `needs-fixes`, or any item with prior work.

**Branch-context verification — mandatory immediately after entering the worktree**

After `cd <worktree-path>`, verify the active branch before doing any work. `git switch` and `git worktree add` output is filtered by RTK (the shell proxy), suppressing the confirmation message — without explicit verification the agent cannot detect a wrong-branch outcome until a commit reveals the error (the Batch 33 incident: commits landed on `fix/pr-agent-classifier-label-aware-2` instead of the intended `fix/487-stale-tracker-status-transitions`). Use `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, which produces a single branch-name token and is RTK-safe:

```bash
# Verify branch context — always visible even through RTK filtering:
CURRENT=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
EXPECTED="<branch-prefix>/<slug>"
if [ "$CURRENT" != "$EXPECTED" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: expected branch $EXPECTED, currently on $CURRENT. Aborting."
  exit 1
fi
echo "Branch context verified: $CURRENT"
```

**Local reviewer override continuity — verify once after entering the worktree**

`git worktree add` carries no gitignored files, so the worktree has no
`.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` of its own. The workflow scripts resolve a linked
worktree's override from the main clone automatically (#1560); confirm that
from inside the worktree now, rather than discovering it in Step 7a as a
zero-reachable-reviewer hard-fail:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```bash
python3 ./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-config-resolver.py review-overrides --repo-root "$(pwd -P)" \
  | grep -E '^(LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE|LOCAL_OVERRIDE_ORIGIN|MAIN_CLONE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE)='
```

Expected for a worktree of a clone that has a local override:
`LOCAL_OVERRIDE_ORIGIN=main_clone` with `LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` equal to
`MAIN_CLONE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE`. `MAIN_CLONE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` set while
`LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` is empty means the override exists and is not being
applied — stop and report it to the Portfolio Orchestrator; do not copy the
file by hand. All three empty means the clone has no local override and the
shared `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` applies.

Apply the same verification pattern any time a `git switch` or `git checkout <branch>` is issued outside the worktree-creation path (e.g., when a stage protocol's recovery step asks to switch branches):

```bash
git switch <branch>
# Verify — always visible even through RTK filtering:
CURRENT=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if [ "$CURRENT" != "<branch>" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: expected branch <branch>, currently on $CURRENT. Aborting."
  exit 1
fi
```

**Pre-mutation isolation self-check — mandatory for `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`**

Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation,
tracker mutation, or stage-agent handoff, verify that the active runner context
matches the isolation assignment from the Portfolio Orchestrator:

- Expected worktree path is present, absolute, and matches the resolved
  `<worktree-path>`.
- Observed directory (`pwd -P`) equals the expected worktree path or begins with
  the expected worktree path followed by `/`, and is not the main repository
  root.
- Expected branch is present and matches `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
- Artifact repo root is present.
- Approved base branch is present.
- `isolation: "worktree"` is present.
- Mutation classification is `mutating` for any runner that will edit files,
  change branches, commit, push, open or update PRs, modify labels, or update
  tracker state.

If the observed directory is outside the expected worktree path, if the runner
is in the main repo root, or if the observed branch differs from the expected
branch, stop before mutation with guardrail stop condition
`unclear_requirements`. The stop report must include the stop condition name,
item identifier, expected worktree, observed directory, expected branch,
observed branch, and the human action needed to unblock.

If there is evidence that mutation may already have occurred outside the
assigned worktree, escalate for human inspection instead of trying to repair it
automatically. Do not reset, restore, stash, commit, or delete the suspect
changes without explicit human direction.

Record the pre-mutation isolation self-check result in the Work Item Runner
terminal summary. The Portfolio Orchestrator must treat missing, failed, or
escalated isolation evidence as non-terminal for the batch item.

**Runtime CWD guard — activate immediately after entering the worktree**

After `cd <worktree-path>`, source and initialise the CWD guard. This provides runtime enforcement that catches branch-switching commands issued from the wrong directory **at execution time** rather than only at the post-agent Step 5.2 inspection:

```bash
# Derive main repo root reliably (never use --show-toplevel inside a worktree)
MAIN_REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." && pwd)"
WORKTREE_PATH="$(pwd -P)"

# Source the guard (path is relative to the worktree, which mirrors the main repo structure)
source "$MAIN_REPO_ROOT/scripts/development-workflow/worktree-cwd-guard.sh"
worktree_cwd_guard_init "$WORKTREE_PATH" "$MAIN_REPO_ROOT"
```

Once initialised, replace bare `git switch`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, and `git restore` calls with the guarded wrappers exported by the script: `git_switch`, `git_checkout`, `git_reset`, and `git_restore`. If a stage protocol's step calls `git checkout develop && git checkout -b <branch>`, skip it entirely (the worktree was already created on the correct branch) — but if you must call it, use the guarded wrapper so any accidental main-repo targeting is caught immediately.

The guard is **non-blocking**: it emits a `GUARDRAIL WARNING` and returns exit code 1 on a CWD violation, but does not abort the outer shell. Check the return value or `set -e` in the enclosing script to convert warnings into hard failures where appropriate.

**Guard scope limitation — Claude Code subagents**: The `source`/`worktree_cwd_guard_init` sequence above applies to the item-orchestrator's own shell session. It does **not** propagate to Claude Code subagents dispatched via the `Agent` tool — each subagent starts with an independent execution context and has no knowledge of the parent's shell environment. The guard therefore cannot intercept branch-switching commands issued inside a stage subagent. For stage subagents (e.g., `developer`, `tech-lead`), worktree discipline is enforced entirely through the handoff prompt and the agent's own system-prompt rules. See "Stage-agent handoff branch-skip requirement" below.

**Stage-agent handoff branch-skip requirement** (`BATCH_CONTEXT=true` only): Every stage-agent handoff (to `developer`, `tech-lead`, `product-manager`, or any other stage agent) when `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` **must** include:

1. The literal resolved `<worktree-path>` value (e.g., `/path/to/repo/.claude/worktrees/lh-168/fix-lh-168-slug`).
2. The expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, mutation
   classification, and `isolation: "worktree"` when the stage agent may mutate
   artifacts.
3. The explicit instruction: "BATCH_CONTEXT=true — the worktree is already on branch `<branch>`. Do NOT run `git checkout develop`, `git checkout -b`, `git switch`, `git reset`, or `git restore` from the main repo root. Confirm `pwd -P` equals `<worktree-path>` or begins with `<worktree-path>/` before any git state-changing command."
4. The explicit instruction: "For substantial or multi-part mutating item work,
   commit immediately after each completed logical sub-part so interrupted runs
   have a recoverable checkpoint. Do not intentionally batch all completed
   sub-parts into one end-of-run commit. Single-step work with no meaningful
   completed intermediate checkpoint may use one final commit. Never commit
   incomplete, failing, or incoherent edits only to satisfy this requirement."

Omitting any required instruction or metadata field from the handoff is the root
cause of the branch-leak pattern where stage subagents run Protocol 03's
branching steps (`git checkout develop && git checkout -b <branch>`) from the
main repo root CWD, silently switching the main working tree to the feature
branch.

**Critical: Worktree Git Discipline** (`BATCH_CONTEXT=true` only)

**Pre-operation checklist — verify before every git state-changing command**

Before issuing any `git switch`, `git checkout`, `git checkout -b`, `git reset`, or `git restore` command, confirm both conditions below. If either check fails, do not run the command — correct the path or use the `-C` flag instead.

1. **Confirm you are operating inside the worktree, not the main repository root.**
   Run `pwd -P` and confirm the output equals `<worktree-path>` or begins with `<worktree-path>/`. If it is outside the assigned worktree, you are in the wrong directory. `cd <worktree-path>` or use `git -C <worktree-path>` before continuing.

2. **Confirm the command targets the current worktree branch, not a base branch.**
   Running `git checkout develop` (or any other base branch) inside the worktree will fail because `develop` is already checked out in the main working tree — git prevents the same branch from being checked out in two locations simultaneously. If a stage protocol's branching step says `git checkout develop && git checkout -b <branch>`, skip it entirely: the worktree was already created on the correct branch.

When operating inside a worktree, **never** run the following commands against the main repo root:

- `git switch <branch>`
- `git checkout <branch>`
- `git checkout -b <branch>`
- `git reset [--hard|--soft|--mixed] ...`
- `git restore ...`

These commands change the branch or modify files in the main working tree, breaking isolation for all concurrent agents and the human operator. Violating this rule leaves the main repo in a broken state (e.g., pointing at a feature branch) that blocks all subsequent agents and the human operator until manually corrected.

**Required alternatives:**

- Run all git operations scoped to the worktree: `cd <worktree-path> && git <command>`
- Or use the `-C` flag: `git -C <worktree-path> <command>`

Read-only inspection of the main repo is always permitted and must use `-C` without switching branches:

```bash
git -C <main-repo-root> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

**Optional — platform-specific: pre-tool-use hook guidance**

For runners that support pre-tool-use hooks (e.g., Claude Code), a non-blocking hook can be configured to warn when a prohibited git command is issued from the main repo root while a worktree is active. The hook should:

1. Intercept tool calls for `Bash` commands.
2. Check whether the command includes any of `switch`, `checkout`, `checkout -b`, `reset`, or `restore` as git subcommands.
3. Compare the working directory of the command against the main repo root path.
4. If the working directory matches the main repo root and the command is state-changing, emit a warning: `"GUARDRAIL WARNING: git state-changing command targeting main repo root detected while worktree is active. Use git -C <worktree-path> or cd <worktree-path> && git instead."`
5. The hook is **non-blocking** — it warns but does not abort the command. Blocking hooks can cause cascading failures when legitimate read-only commands are incorrectly matched.

This hook is advisory and not required for the guardrail to function. The Critical block above is the normative rule; this hook provides an additional safety signal for supported runners.

**Common worktree gotcha — `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the worktree path, not the main repo root**

When an agent runs inside an isolated worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<branch>/`), `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the _worktree_ path rather than the main repo root. Any script or agent instruction that relies on this command to locate `node_modules/`, project-level config files, or other resources installed at the main repo root will construct wrong paths.

Use `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` instead — it always points to the `.git` directory of the _main_ repo regardless of which worktree is active. Append `/..` to get the main repo root:

```bash
# Wrong — returns the worktree path when run inside an isolated worktree:
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Correct — always returns the main repo root, even from a worktree:
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/..
```

Apply this pattern whenever a stage agent, script, or implementation step needs to reference `node_modules/`, root-level config files, or any path that lives at the main repo root rather than in the worktree.

**Important — stage protocol compatibility**: When working inside a worktree created with this method, the stage protocol's initial branching steps (`git fetch origin`, `git checkout develop`, `git pull origin develop`, `git checkout -b ...`) are **already satisfied** by the worktree creation above. The stage agent should skip those steps and proceed directly to the implementation work. If the stage agent runs `git checkout develop` inside the worktree, it will fail because `develop` is already checked out in the main working tree and git prevents the same branch from being checked out in multiple worktrees simultaneously.

**Critical safety rule — never modify the main working tree's branch**: An agent running inside a worktree **must never** run `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git reset`, or any command that changes the checked-out branch of the **main working tree**. Violating this rule leaves the main repo in a broken state (e.g., pointing at a `worktree-agent-*` branch) that breaks subsequent operations for all other agents and for the human operator.

- All git operations must target **the current worktree only**. Never `cd` out of the worktree into the main repo root and then run branch-switching commands.
- If you need to read information from the main repo (e.g., inspect its current branch), use `git -C <main-repo-root> <command>` without switching branches, for example:

  ```bash
  git -C /path/to/main-repo rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
  ```

- After the item reaches a terminal condition and **before** removing the worktree, verify the main working tree is still on the expected integration branch **and has no uncommitted modifications**. This check mirrors Protocol 90 Step 5.2 — use the same four-case handling described there. Resolve the expected branch from your workflow context (typically `develop` for this template, but use whatever `integration_branch` is configured for the repo):

  ```bash
  INTEGRATION_BRANCH="<integration-branch>"  # e.g., develop (or main in repos configured that way)
  MAIN_BRANCH=$(git -C <main-repo-root> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  MAIN_STATUS=$(git -C <main-repo-root> status --porcelain)

  if [ "$MAIN_BRANCH" != "$INTEGRATION_BRANCH" ] && [ -z "$MAIN_STATUS" ]; then
    # Case 1: Wrong branch + clean — auto-correct and log guardrail violation
    echo "GUARDRAIL: main working tree was on '$MAIN_BRANCH' after this agent completed. Expected '$INTEGRATION_BRANCH'. Auto-correcting."
    echo "IMPORTANT: Record this as a guardrail violation in retrospective notes — the agent likely ran in the main tree instead of the worktree, or leaked a branch switch."
    git -C <main-repo-root> switch "$INTEGRATION_BRANCH"
    # Proceed normally after correction

  elif [ "$MAIN_BRANCH" != "$INTEGRATION_BRANCH" ] && [ -n "$MAIN_STATUS" ]; then
    # Case 2: Wrong branch + dirty — halt and escalate
    echo "ERROR: main working tree is on '$MAIN_BRANCH' (expected '$INTEGRATION_BRANCH') AND has uncommitted modifications."
    echo "$MAIN_STATUS"
    echo "Do not proceed. The human must inspect, discard or commit these changes, and restore the main tree to '$INTEGRATION_BRANCH' before the next dispatch."
    exit 1

  elif [ "$MAIN_BRANCH" = "$INTEGRATION_BRANCH" ] && [ -z "$MAIN_STATUS" ]; then
    # Case 3: Correct branch + clean — proceed normally
    :

  elif [ "$MAIN_BRANCH" = "$INTEGRATION_BRANCH" ] && [ -n "$MAIN_STATUS" ]; then
    # Case 4: Correct branch + dirty — halt and escalate
    echo "WARNING: main working tree is on '$INTEGRATION_BRANCH' but has uncommitted modifications:"
    echo "$MAIN_STATUS"
    echo "Possible cause: a stage agent leaked file writes outside the worktree boundary."
    echo "Do NOT commit or discard these changes without human review. Do not dispatch additional agents."
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

  For Case 1, auto-correct is safe because the tree is clean — no uncommitted work is at risk. The guardrail violation must still be logged in retrospective notes because it indicates the isolation boundary was breached (the agent likely ran in the main tree rather than the worktree, or a stage protocol issued a branch-switching command that leaked into the main tree). For Cases 2 and 4, **stop and report to the human** — the human must inspect and resolve before the next batch dispatch.

**Critical safety rule — Write and Edit paths inside a worktree**: Every `Write` and
`Edit` tool call issued within an active worktree session **must** target a path under
`<worktree-path>/...`. Any path that does NOT begin with the resolved `<worktree-path>`
value is a main-repo path — treat it as a red flag and correct it before calling the tool.

- Before calling `Write` or `Edit`, mentally verify: "Does this absolute path start with
  `<worktree-path>/`?" If not, prepend `<worktree-path>/` to the relative portion of the
  path.
- The item-orchestrator must include the resolved literal value of `<worktree-path>` in
  every stage-agent handoff (not just the first), so each agent can validate paths against
  it independently.
- Paths under `<worktree-path>/.tmp/` are within the worktree boundary and are permitted.
- This rule applies only when `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` and a dedicated worktree exists; for
  non-batch runs, no reminder is injected.

**Optional: pre-tool-use hook for WORKTREE_ROOT validation**

A pre-tool-use hook can enforce the Write/Edit path rule automatically:

1. Set the `WORKTREE_ROOT` environment variable to the resolved worktree path when
   launching the agent session.
2. In the hook, intercept `Write` and `Edit` tool calls only.
3. If `WORKTREE_ROOT` is unset, skip the check (non-worktree session — no-op).
4. If the target path does not start with `$WORKTREE_ROOT`, emit:
   `"GUARDRAIL: Write/Edit target '<path>' is outside the designated worktree
'<WORKTREE_ROOT>'. Correct the path before proceeding."`
5. The hook is **non-blocking** — it warns but does not prevent the tool call. This
   allows the agent to correct the path in subsequent calls and prevents cascading
   failures from false positives.
6. The hook must NOT intercept read-only tools (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`).

7. **Suggested worktree path**: `<repo-root>/.claude/worktrees/<item-id>/<branch-prefix>-<slug>` where `<item-id>` is the issue number, tracker ID, or slug.

8. After the item reaches a terminal condition, the cleanup script will remove the worktree:

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Change directory to the main repo root BEFORE deleting the worktree
cd <repo-root>
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**Critical safety rule:** You **must** `cd` to the repository root or any other valid directory **before** executing `git worktree remove`. If the shell's current working directory (CWD) is inside the worktree being deleted, the directory will cease to exist immediately after `git worktree remove` completes. All subsequent bash commands will fail with "directory not found" errors, causing the orchestration to break and requiring manual intervention or agent re-delegation.

After removing the worktree, verify that the CWD is still valid by running a simple command like `pwd` before executing any further shell operations.

**When not in batch dispatch**: Worktree creation is optional only for direct
single-item runs where `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` is absent. Mutating explicit-list
batch dispatch, including sequential fallback, must use the Protocol 90
manifest-assigned worktree path.

**Permission-denial early exit (subagent runs only)**: If at any point during the run the harness responds with the known harness failure pattern — a message containing the phrase `"Permission to use"` AND a denied tool name (`Edit`, `Write`, or `Bash`) — the subagent must **immediately stop all further work** and return the following structured string to the Portfolio Orchestrator:

```
SUBAGENT_PERMISSION_DENIAL: [tool] tool denied on <denied-target>. No partial work committed. Falling back to orchestrator inline execution.
```

The `<denied-target>` field identifies what was denied and must be populated as follows:

- **`Edit` or `Write` denial**: list every denied file path as a comma-separated list of repo-relative, normalized paths, sorted lexicographically, with no duplicates and no surrounding spaces (e.g., `.claude/agents/developer.md,.cursor/agents/developer.md`). When only one path was denied, write it without a trailing comma.
- **`Bash` denial**: use the denied command pattern as reported by the harness (e.g., `Bash(gh api:*)`). There is no file path to report for a Bash denial.

This field is mandatory in all cases so the orchestrator can identify and resolve the permission gap before retrying.

**No silent workarounds — this is an absolute rule**: When `Edit` or `Write` is denied for any path (including `.claude/agents/**`, `.cursor/agents/**`, or any other file), the subagent MUST NOT use any alternative mechanism to write the same content. The following substitutions are all explicitly prohibited:

- `Bash` with `echo`, `cat`, `tee`, `printf`, `>`, or any shell redirection
- Python subprocess (`python3 -c "open(...).write(...)"` or equivalent)
- `gh api --method PUT /repos/.../contents/...` (GitHub Contents API)
- Any other indirect write path

**Rationale**: These side-channel writes bypass the canonical `Edit`/`Write` tool pipeline, which means any pre-tool-use hooks (e.g., path validation, write tracking) do not fire. They also make it impossible for the Portfolio Orchestrator to detect that a permission gap exists and perform the correct inline fallback. Silent degradation to a workaround tool is a protocol violation that erodes the orchestrator's ability to track item state reliably.

Before exiting:

- Do **not** apply any PR labels.
- Do **not** commit any partial work.
- Do **not** update the tracker status.

The Portfolio Orchestrator will handle recovery via the inline fallback described in `90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` Step 4.1.

This protocol stays scoped to one item. It may call different stage agents over time, but it must not start scanning or dispatching unrelated items.

### CHANGELOG in parallel batches

See Protocol 90 Step 3.6 for the canonical CHANGELOG strategy in parallel
batches. Normal implementation PRs write per-item fragments under
`changelog.d/`; final `CHANGELOG.md` assembly happens during Prepare Release.

### Scope Boundary Rule for Dispatched Agents

When dispatching a stage agent (creator, reviewer, or fixer), include the following explicit instruction:

> **Critical scope rule**: This item is assigned only to [ISSUE_ID]. Modify **only** files directly related to this issue. If a finding or review comment requires changes outside this issue's scope (e.g., fixing issues in unrelated modules, applying a new pattern to the broader codebase, or addressing tech debt elsewhere), do **not** implement it. Instead:
>
> 1. Note it as a separate finding
> 2. Suggest opening a new issue if appropriate
> 3. Continue with in-scope work only
>
> This is critical in parallel batch orchestration where multiple agents work concurrently. Out-of-scope changes cause merge conflicts and waste review cycles.

This rule prevents agents from making changes that affect unrelated issues and causing downstream conflicts in batch runs.

---

## Step 3.5: Pre-flight Permission Self-Check (Subagent Runs Only)

**Applies to**: Work Item Runner subagents dispatched as part of an explicit-list batch (`BATCH_CONTEXT=true`). This step is **optional but recommended** — the permission-denial early-exit in Step 3 (above) covers mid-run failures even without the self-check.

Before calling any creator-stage agent or making any file edits, perform a lightweight sanity check to verify that both `Edit` and `Bash` are accessible:

1. **Test `Edit`**: Use the `Edit` tool to create `.tmp/permission-preflight.tmp` with a single comment line (`# preflight-check`). This is the primary check — the Batch 5 incident (#160) was specifically about `Edit` being denied while `Bash` remained available.
2. **Test `Bash`**: Use `Bash` to delete the temp file:

   ```bash
   rm -f .tmp/permission-preflight.tmp
   ```

If either tool call is denied (harness responds with a permission-denied message), exit immediately before any creator-stage work:

```
SUBAGENT_PERMISSION_DENIAL: [DENIED_TOOL] tool denied on <denied-target>. No partial work committed. Falling back to orchestrator inline execution.
```

**Self-check rules**:

- Always target `.tmp/` for the self-check write (this path is gitignored).
- Clean up the temp file after the check regardless of outcome.
- Never touch tracked files during the self-check.
- After the write, run a quick sanity check to ensure no tracked file was accidentally modified:

  ```bash
  git status --porcelain
  ```

  If the output is non-empty, clean up the `.tmp/permission-preflight.tmp` artifact, emit a distinct error (`SELF_CHECK_DIRTY_WORKTREE: unexpected tracked file modifications detected — see git status output above`), and abort for human inspection. Do **not** emit `SUBAGENT_PERMISSION_DENIAL:` for this case.

If the self-check succeeds, proceed normally to the creator-stage work.

---

## Step 4: Execute and Re-evaluate

Run the next deterministic action for the selected item, then immediately re-evaluate the item state.

Expected chain:

For spec and plan PRs, the creator-stage output includes the `Document Quality
Gate` log in the draft PR description before Step 7a begins. If the log is
missing or obviously incomplete, treat the creator stage as incomplete and fix
the PR description before running reviewer readiness loops.

`creator -> draft PR opened with Document Quality Gate log when applicable -> internal review gate with all review.on_draft.runner reviewers (Step 7a) -> draft GitHub reviewer gate with review.on_draft.github -> gh pr ready -> ready GitHub reviewer phase with review.on_ready.github (Step 7) -> regression label (Step 7b, implementation PRs only) -> CI loop (Step 8) -> label readiness checklist (Step 8a) -> tracker status update (Step 8b) -> independent PR verification (Step 8c) -> wait or escalation`

After any subagent finishes, determine whether the item still has a deterministic next action:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --branch <branch>
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --pr <number>
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --development <path>
```

Do not stop after a single creator or reviewer stage if the next action is deterministic.

---

## Step 5: Resume Rules

When work already exists, resume rather than restart.

- If a development folder already maps to `Spec Ready`, `Plan Ready`, or `In Development`, continue from that state
- If a workflow branch already exists, use `workflow-next-action.sh --branch <branch>`
- If a PR already exists, use `workflow-next-action.sh --pr <number>`
- If labels indicate `needs-fixes`, enter the fix loop instead of reopening the stage from scratch
- If a run aborts mid-turn due to model quota, stream timeout, or runner unavailability, follow [`provider-contingency-runner-failover.md`](../provider-contingency-runner-failover.md) before manually changing PR labels or restarting from scratch

The Work Item Runner owns the full control loop for this item until it reaches a terminal condition.

---

## Step 6: Notify Humans

After the selected item reaches a terminal condition, provide a concise summary:

```markdown
## Work Item Runner Summary

- Item: [identifier]
- Final state: ready for human review / waiting on human decision / blocked / escalated
- Path taken: plan written -> reviewed -> PR opened -> automated review clean -> CI green
- Next human action: merge PR / answer architecture question / unblock dependency
- Local reviewer head evidence: LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=[0|1], LOCAL_AI_REVIEWED_HEAD=[sha|empty], LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT=[1|0|empty]

## Ground-Truth Completion Verification

[Paste the exact output from `scripts/development-workflow/item-completion-self-check.sh`.
For ready/done/waiting-on-merge/cleanup success, a non-zero helper exit is
non-terminal. For blocked or escalated states, a non-zero helper exit may be
terminal only when the failed surface is the explicit blocker; report the
expected value, observed value, and the next gate or human action required.]
```

**Retrospective suggestion (standalone runs only)**:

If this Work Item Runner was invoked **directly by a human** (i.e., `BATCH_CONTEXT` is not set or is `false`), do **not** suggest a retrospective immediately after the terminal condition summary. The work is not complete yet — the human still needs to review and merge the PR.

Instead, suggest the retrospective **after the human confirms the PR has been merged** (e.g., via `/post-merge-cleanup` or an explicit "it's merged" message). At that point, offer:

> Would you like to run a retrospective on this session's work?

If the human agrees, follow `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06-retrospective-protocol.md`. The retrospective will analyze the PRs from this item run using both GitHub data and the conversation context from this session.

**When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`** (dispatched by the Portfolio Orchestrator): suppress the retrospective suggestion entirely. The Portfolio Orchestrator will suggest the retrospective after the full batch has been merged, not when PRs reach `ready-for-human-review`.

---

## Step 7a: Internal Review Gate (Draft PR)

**Guardrails check — delegated review gate**: Before entering this review
handoff, check whether the effective guardrails grant delegated review authority
for this stage. Per `guardrails-enforcement.md` section 3 Gate 4:

- If the effective mode is `delegated` or `autonomous` and the stage
  `may_merge_pr` is not explicitly `false`: the runner may make the review
  decision using the review-and-fix behavior described in this step.
- Otherwise: leave the PR at its normal `ready-for-human-review` handoff — do
  not make the review decision autonomously.

Run this step immediately after opening a draft PR, and again after any push that addresses internal-review findings.

### Draft-state pre-check (mandatory, before any reviewer is dispatched)

Before dispatching any reviewer, check whether the PR is currently in draft state:

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json isDraft --jq '.isDraft'
```

If the result is `true` (PR is a draft), inspect the resolved
`review.on_draft.runner` list from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` (after any
`.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` override) and the `review.on_draft.github` /
`review.on_ready.github` lists.

If `coderabbit` is **only** listed under `review.on_ready.github`, keep the PR as
a draft during Step 7a. This is intentional: `.coderabbit.yaml` has
`reviews.auto_review.drafts: false`, so draft state prevents CodeRabbit from
starting before the draft GitHub reviewer gate. If `coderabbit` is listed under
`review.on_draft.github` while draft reviews are disabled, treat the reviewer
placement as a configuration issue to fix before Step 7: draft GitHub reviewers
are expected to support draft PRs.

If `coderabbit` is listed as a **runner reviewer** and is therefore required
inside Step 7a itself, convert the PR to non-draft before triggering reviewers:

```bash
gh pr ready <pr_number>
```

Post a comment on the PR explaining the action:

> `INFO: PR converted from draft to non-draft before Step 7a internal review. Reason: CodeRabbit is configured as an internal reviewer and '.coderabbit.yaml' sets 'auto_review.drafts: false' — CodeRabbit silently skips draft PRs. Converting now to ensure full reviewer coverage.`

**Why this matters**: CodeRabbit (and similar tools) configured with
`auto_review.drafts: false` do not post any skip notice when they bypass a draft
PR. That behavior is useful when CodeRabbit is intentionally configured as an
a ready-phase reviewer, because it lets the draft GitHub gate clear first. It is
unsafe when CodeRabbit is configured as a Step 7a runner reviewer, because the
internal review gate would silently pass with reduced coverage.

**Reviewer-to-draft-restriction mapping**:

| Reviewer     | Skips draft PRs when...                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `coderabbit` | `.coderabbit.yaml` has `reviews.auto_review.drafts: false` (the default)    |
| `claude`     | Never — Claude Code agents always review regardless of draft state          |
| `codex`      | Never — Codex skill reviewers always review regardless of draft state       |

To check whether `.coderabbit.yaml` restricts draft PRs:

```bash
grep -E '^\s*drafts:\s*false' .coderabbit.yaml
```

If the file is absent or the key is not present, CodeRabbit defaults to `drafts: false` — treat it as draft-restricting.

**Important**: Do not convert a draft PR to non-draft merely because CodeRabbit
appears in `review.on_draft.github` or `review.on_ready.github`. Convert early
only when CodeRabbit is part of `review.on_draft.runner`. Otherwise, keep the
draft state until the draft GitHub reviewer gate below has passed.

If the PR is **not** in draft state, skip this pre-check entirely and proceed to the Design Review Gate.

### Design Review Gate (implementation PRs only)

This gate applies only to PRs on `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, and `hotfix/*` branches (BR-1). It is skipped entirely for `spec/*` and `implementation-plan/*` branches — proceed directly to "Determining which reviewers to run" for those PR types.

#### Frontend-file detection

Inspect the PR's changed files:

```bash
gh pr diff <pr_number> --name-only
```

A file is **frontend** if any of the following conditions hold:

- Its extension is one of: `.html`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte` (BR-2)
- Its extension is `.js` or `.ts` **and** its path starts with one of these directory prefixes: `src/`, `app/`, `pages/`, `components/`, `public/`, `static/`, or `assets/` (BR-2)

`.js` and `.ts` files at the repository root or under `scripts/` are **not** treated as frontend.

These detection rules are extensible — downstream teams that need additional extensions or paths must update this list (and keep `.claude/agents/design-reviewer.md` and `.cursor/agents/design-reviewer.md` in sync).

#### Three execution paths

**Path A — No frontend changes detected (Use Case 2):**

Skip the design-reviewer agent entirely. No comment is posted. Proceed to "Determining which reviewers to run". This skip is not a failure (BR-10).

**Path B — Frontend changes detected, provider available (Use Case 1):**

Invoke the `design-reviewer` agent, passing:

- The PR number
- The list of changed frontend files
- The `PREVIEW_URL` environment variable (if set) or instructions to start the development server

After the agent posts its PR comment, parse the verdict from the comment header (the comment must begin with `## Design Review Summary` and the verdict must appear as `**Verdict**: <value>` — BR-9):

| Verdict          | Action                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Approved`       | Proceed normally to "Determining which reviewers to run"                                                                          |
| `Needs Revision` | Treat as a review finding. Do not advance to `ready-for-human-review` until the issues are resolved or explicitly accepted (BR-5) |
| `Skipped`        | Development server was unreachable; log the skip and continue without blocking (BR-4)                                             |

**Path C — Frontend changes detected, provider unavailable (Use Case 3):**

Invoke the `design-reviewer` agent; it will detect provider unavailability, post a skip notice, and exit with verdict `Skipped`. Parse the `Skipped` verdict and continue without blocking the PR (BR-3).

#### Preview URL resolution

The design-reviewer agent resolves the preview base URL in this order (BR-11):

1. `PREVIEW_URL` environment variable, treated as the base URL (file-relative paths are appended).
2. Local development server started by the agent (the server address becomes the base URL).
3. If neither is available, the agent skips preview navigation and falls back to a report noting that no live preview was accessible.

#### Browser automation provider

The agent reads `browser_automation.provider` from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`. For this repository the provider is `playwright_cli`. The agent must not hard-code a provider value (BR-8).

### Determining which reviewers to run

Read the `review.on_draft.runner` list from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`. For local
developer overrides, prefer `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` (gitignored) with the
same nested review shape:

```yaml
review:
  on_draft:
    runner:
      - cursor
  internal_reviewers_unavailable_policy: warn
```

The local YAML file takes precedence over `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`. This allows
developers without access to all configured review tools to run a subset, such
as only `cursor`, without changing the shared config.

Resolve the effective lists with the config resolver rather than by reading
the files by hand. It applies the precedence above and locates the override
file for the checkout you are actually in:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```bash
python3 ./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-config-resolver.py review-overrides --repo-root "$(pwd -P)"
```

`REVIEW_ON_DRAFT_RUNNER` is the override list (empty when the local file sets
none — then `review.on_draft.runner` from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` applies).
`LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` names the file the values came from and
`LOCAL_OVERRIDE_ORIGIN` where it lives: `checkout` (this directory),
`main_clone` (this directory is a linked git worktree with no file of its own,
so the main clone's applies — `git worktree add` never carries gitignored
files, #1560), or `override_root` (`WORKFLOW_LOCAL_REVIEW_OVERRIDE_ROOT`, the
reviewer-loop handoff path from #1033). `MAIN_CLONE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` is set
whenever a linked worktree's main clone holds a local override, whichever file
was applied. A worktree created through the Protocol 90 isolation manifest
therefore resolves the same reviewer configuration as the main clone without
anyone copying the file into it; do not copy it by hand — a copy shadows the
main clone's file and drifts from it.

Supported runner reviewer values: `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, `coderabbit`.

If neither config file defines `review.on_draft.runner`, fall back to running
the stage-appropriate reviewer once (default behavior: `claude`).

When the local file supplies an override, log the following before running the
availability check:

> `INFO: Using review.on_draft.runner override from .ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml: [<override-list>]. Original list: [<yaml-list>].`

No warning comment is posted for reviewers intentionally removed by the override list (`override-excluded`). If any reviewer still present in the override list is unreachable at runtime, post the standard warning comment for those unreachable reviewers (the runtime-availability check still applies to the override list).

### Runtime-availability check

Before dispatching any reviewer, classify each entry in the resolved list as `reachable` or `unreachable`. For `claude`, `cursor`, and `codex`, the check is deterministic and requires no external network call — runner identity is a sufficient proxy for reviewer reachability because the gate only dispatches reviewers the current runner can invoke without a cross-runner CLI handoff. For `coderabbit`, reachability is determined at runtime via an App installation check (see below).

#### Reachability classification table

| Runner context                                    | `claude` reachable? | `cursor` reachable? | `codex` reachable? | `coderabbit` reachable?           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Claude Code (direct human session)                | Yes                 | No                  | No                 | Determined at runtime (App check) |
| Claude Code subagent (dispatched by orchestrator) | Yes                 | No                  | No                 | Determined at runtime (App check) |
| Cursor direct session or subagent                 | No                  | Yes                 | No                 | Determined at runtime (App check) |
| Codex runner / Codex skill                        | Yes                 | No                  | Yes                | Determined at runtime (App check) |
| Direct human (shell / CI with `gh`)               | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | Determined at runtime (App check) |

To determine `coderabbit` reachability, the runner checks whether `coderabbitai[bot]` has any prior activity on the repository (App installation signal — via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/installation` or by checking the PR for a prior CodeRabbit comment), **and** confirms that `.coderabbit.yaml` does not disable auto-review (`reviews.auto_review.enabled: true` required). If either check fails, classify `coderabbit` as `unreachable`.

Note: the `auto_review.drafts: false` restriction is **not** treated as an unreachability condition here — it is handled upstream by the "Draft-state pre-check" at the top of Step 7a, which converts any draft PR to non-draft before this reachability check runs. By the time the reachability check executes, the PR is guaranteed to be non-draft (if the pre-check determined that a draft-restricting reviewer was in the list).

#### Policy resolution

After classifying each reviewer, apply the configured policy. Read
`internal_reviewers_unavailable_policy` from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` (or its
local override in `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml`). This policy key is retained
for compatibility even though the reviewer list moved to
`review.on_draft.runner`. If the key is absent, the default is `warn`.

To override the policy locally without changing shared config, prefer
`.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml`:

```yaml
review:
  on_draft:
    runner:
      - cursor
  internal_reviewers_unavailable_policy: warn
```

Allowed values: `warn` (default), `fail-if-any-unavailable`.

| Condition                                                 | Policy                    | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Zero reviewers reachable                                  | Any                       | **Hard-fail** — post the Step 7a summary comment (as error/blocked comment per Use Case 2) and stop. Do NOT call `gh pr ready`. Escalate to human.                                                                                                                                               |
| One or more reviewers unreachable, at least one reachable | `warn` (default)          | Post a warning comment to the PR naming each unreachable reviewer and the runner context, record each as `skipped (unreachable)`, then proceed with the reachable subset.                                                                                                                        |
| Any reviewer unreachable                                  | `fail-if-any-unavailable` | **Hard-fail** — same outcome as zero-reachable (no reviewers dispatched, PR stays draft, escalate to human) even when some reviewers are reachable. Post the Step 7a summary comment using the hard-fail comment format **Case B** below and stop. Do NOT call `gh pr ready`. Escalate to human. |
| All reviewers reachable                                   | Any                       | Proceed normally — no warning comment, no deviation from the existing flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Warning comment format (one or more unreachable, `warn` policy)

Post via `gh pr comment` before dispatching any reviewer. Use the following wording for each unreachable reviewer:

> `WARNING: internal_reviewer '<reviewer>' unreachable from current runner (<runner-context>) — skipping. Only '<reachable-list>' will run in this Step 7a cycle. Reviewer coverage is reduced from <total> to <reachable-count>.`

Example for `codex` unreachable from a Claude Code subagent with
`review.on_draft.runner: [claude, codex]`:

> `WARNING: internal_reviewer 'codex' unreachable from current runner (Claude Code subagent) — skipping. Only 'claude' will run in this Step 7a cycle. Reviewer coverage is reduced from 2 to 1.`

#### Hard-fail comment format

Post via `gh pr comment`. This comment doubles as the BR-7 mandatory Step 7a summary comment in the hard-fail case. Use the appropriate template based on the hard-fail condition:

**Case A — Zero reviewers reachable (any policy):**

> `Step 7a BLOCKED: no internal reviewer is reachable from the current runner. Effective reviewer set: none. Reachable: []. Unreachable: [<reviewer> (unreachable), ...]. Verdict: hard-fail. Local override: <local-override-state>. To unblock: run Step 7a from a runner that supports all configured reviewers, or temporarily override 'review.on_draft.runner' via .ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml.`

`<local-override-state>` comes from the resolver output, never from a guess
(#1560 AC-3):

- `none` — `LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` and `MAIN_CLONE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` are both
  empty. This is a genuine configuration-policy block.
- `<LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE> (<LOCAL_OVERRIDE_ORIGIN>), applied` — an override was
  resolved and still left zero reachable reviewers; the override itself names
  reviewers this runner cannot reach.
- `present but unpropagated: <MAIN_CLONE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE>` —
  `LOCAL_OVERRIDE_FILE` is empty while the main clone has a file. This is
  almost always a worktree resolving the wrong file rather than a policy
  decision: re-run the resolver from the worktree path (`pwd -P`) and report
  the discrepancy instead of treating the block as final.

**Case B — `fail-if-any-unavailable` policy triggered (one or more reviewers unreachable, but at least one was reachable):**

> `Step 7a BLOCKED: policy 'fail-if-any-unavailable' triggered — one or more internal reviewers are unreachable. No reviewers were dispatched. Effective reviewer set: none (policy block). Reachable: [<reachable-list>]. Unreachable: [<reviewer> (unreachable), ...]. Verdict: hard-fail. To unblock: run Step 7a from a runner where all configured reviewers are reachable, or set internal_reviewers_unavailable_policy to 'warn' temporarily, or override 'review.on_draft.runner' via .ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml.`

### Reviewer dispatch map

For each reviewer in the resolved list, dispatch the stage-appropriate agent:

| Reviewer     | PR branch prefix                                  | Agent / protocol to dispatch                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude`     | `spec/*`                                          | `spec-reviewer` or `01-review-spec-protocol.md`                                                                        |
| `claude`     | `implementation-plan/*`                           | `implementation-plan-reviewer` or `02-review-implementation-plan-protocol.md`                                          |
| `claude`     | `feature/*` / `refactor/*` / `fix/*` / `hotfix/*` | `code-reviewer` or `03-review-implementation-protocol.md`                                                              |
| `cursor`     | `spec/*`                                          | Cursor `spec-reviewer` agent or `01-review-spec-protocol.md`                                                          |
| `cursor`     | `implementation-plan/*`                           | Cursor `implementation-plan-reviewer` agent or `02-review-implementation-plan-protocol.md`                             |
| `cursor`     | `feature/*` / `refactor/*` / `fix/*` / `hotfix/*` | Cursor `code-reviewer` agent or `03-review-implementation-protocol.md`                                                 |
| `codex`      | `spec/*`                                          | `workflow-spec-reviewer` Codex skill against `REVIEW.md`                                                               |
| `codex`      | `implementation-plan/*`                           | `workflow-plan-reviewer` Codex skill against `REVIEW.md`                                                               |
| `codex`      | `feature/*` / `refactor/*` / `fix/*` / `hotfix/*` | `workflow-code-reviewer` Codex skill against `REVIEW.md`                                                               |
| `coderabbit` | `spec/*`                                          | Trigger CodeRabbit via push (auto-review); poll for `coderabbitai[bot]` response — see `coderabbit.md` Step 7a section |
| `coderabbit` | `implementation-plan/*`                           | Trigger CodeRabbit via push (auto-review); poll for `coderabbitai[bot]` response — see `coderabbit.md` Step 7a section |
| `coderabbit` | `feature/*` / `refactor/*` / `fix/*` / `hotfix/*` | Trigger CodeRabbit via push (auto-review); poll for `coderabbitai[bot]` response — see `coderabbit.md` Step 7a section |

### Branch-type detection

Before running any reviewers, classify the PR branch to determine which execution path applies:

- **Implementation PR**: branch matches `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`, or `backport/hotfix/*`. These PRs follow the **two-pass** review procedure below.
- **Non-implementation PR**: branch matches `spec/*` or `implementation-plan/*`. These PRs follow the existing **single-pass** review procedure and are not affected by this section's two-pass rules.

### Multi-reviewer execution rules

Run all configured internal reviewers **sequentially** in the order listed. Each reviewer runs against `REVIEW.md`, applies deterministic fixes directly, and commits + pushes if needed.

Initialize `internal_review_cycle = 0` at the start of Step 7a. Increment each time the full Pass 1 → Pass 2 cycle is restarted (for implementation PRs) or the full reviewer list is restarted (for non-implementation PRs). Escalate to human when `internal_review_cycle` reaches `max_internal_review_cycles` (default: 5).

#### Non-implementation PRs (spec/_, implementation-plan/_): single-pass

| Outcome                                                                                                   | Action                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All reviewers `APPROVED`                                                                                  | Post the Step 7a summary comment (see below), then run `gh pr ready <pr_number>` to convert the draft PR to non-draft, then continue to Step 7 (external automated reviewers) |
| Any reviewer returns `NEEDS REVISION` (fixable) and `internal_review_cycle < max_internal_review_cycles`  | Fixes already applied by the agent; increment `internal_review_cycle`; re-run **all** internal reviewers from the beginning of the list                                       |
| Any reviewer returns `NEEDS REVISION` (fixable) and `internal_review_cycle >= max_internal_review_cycles` | Post the Step 7a summary comment with verdict `escalated — max cycles reached`, then escalate to human                                                                        |
| Any reviewer returns `NEEDS REVISION` (product/design decision)                                           | Post the Step 7a summary comment with verdict `escalated — human decision required`, then stop and escalate to human before proceeding                                        |

All internal reviewers must APPROVE before `gh pr ready` is called. If any reviewer finds issues, fix them and re-run ALL internal reviewers.

#### Implementation PRs (feature/_, fix/_, refactor/_, hotfix/_): two-pass

Implementation PRs run two sequential passes before `gh pr ready` is called. Pass 2 is never dispatched until all reviewers have approved Pass 1 for the current commit.

**Pass 1 (Spec Compliance)**: each reviewer evaluates only the `### Pass 1: Spec Compliance` sub-checklist from `REVIEW.md`. The orchestrator passes the active pass name (`Pass 1: Spec Compliance`) in the dispatch prompt so the reviewer scopes its findings accordingly.

**Pass 2 (Code Quality)**: each reviewer evaluates only the `### Pass 2: Code Quality` sub-checklist from `REVIEW.md`. The orchestrator passes the active pass name (`Pass 2: Code Quality`) in the dispatch prompt. Pass 2 is dispatched only after all reviewers have approved Pass 1.

**Multi-reviewer ordering within each pass**: when multiple internal reviewers are configured, all reviewers complete Pass 1 before any reviewer's Pass 2 is dispatched.

**Same-commit SHA requirement**: when both passes run without a trivial-fix skip, both passes must approve at the same commit SHA before `gh pr ready` is called. When Pass 1 is skipped under the trivial-fix path (see below), only Pass 2 must approve at the current commit SHA — Pass 1's earlier approval (at a prior SHA) remains valid for that cycle.

Both passes must complete with all reviewers `APPROVED` before `gh pr ready` is called. The `internal_review_cycle` counter increments on every fix cycle — whether the fix is trivial (Pass 2 restart only) or non-trivial (full Pass 1 → Pass 2 restart). This ensures that repeated trivial-fix cycles are bounded by `max_internal_review_cycles` and cannot loop indefinitely.

#### Step 7a summary comment (mandatory)

A Step 7a summary comment **must always be posted to the PR** when the gate exits — whether all reviewers ran, some were skipped, or the gate hard-failed (BR-7). Post via `gh pr comment` immediately before `gh pr ready` (in the success path) or immediately before stopping (in the hard-fail or escalation paths).

Required fields:

- **PR type**: implementation (two-pass) or non-implementation (single-pass)
- **Effective reviewer set**: which reviewers actually ran (excluding skipped/unreachable ones)
- **Skipped reviewers**: each reviewer skipped, with reason (e.g., `unreachable`, `override-excluded`)
- **Final verdict**: `APPROVED`, `hard-fail`, or `escalated — <reason>`

Example format for a **non-implementation PR** (single-pass):

```markdown
### Step 7a Internal Review Gate Summary

**PR type**: Non-implementation (single-pass)
**Effective reviewer set**: claude
**Skipped reviewers**: codex (unreachable from Claude Code subagent)
**Verdict**: APPROVED

All reachable internal reviewers approved. Note: codex was unreachable from the current runner — reviewer coverage was reduced from 2 to 1. Human reviewers may re-run Step 7a from a Codex-capable runner if full coverage is required.
```

Example format for an **implementation PR** (two-pass):

```markdown
### Step 7a Internal Review Gate Summary

**PR type**: Implementation (two-pass)
**Effective reviewer set**: claude
**Skipped reviewers**: codex (unreachable from Claude Code subagent)

**Pass 1 (Spec Compliance)**

- claude: APPROVED (0 findings)

**Pass 2 (Code Quality)**

- claude: APPROVED after 1 fix cycle (1 finding resolved)

**Verdict**: APPROVED
All passes approved at commit `abc1234`.
```

In the hard-fail case (zero reachable reviewers or `fail-if-any-unavailable` policy triggered), the hard-fail comment posted in the Runtime-availability check section above **already satisfies BR-7** — do not post a second summary comment.

**Note**: The Step 7a summary comment is a distinct requirement from the Step 7 "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" comment checked in Step 8c. The Step 7a summary covers the internal gate only; Step 8c's check targets the external automated reviewer loop (Step 7). These are separate comments and neither substitutes for the other.

### Step 7a loop parameters

| Parameter                    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max_internal_review_cycles` | 5       | Max fix cycles before escalating. For implementation PRs, increments on every Pass 2 fix — trivial (Pass 2 restart only) or non-trivial (full Pass 1 → Pass 2 restart). For non-implementation PRs, counts full single-pass restarts as before |

Step 7a runs **before** Step 7 (external reviewers). Only proceed to Step 7 once all internal reviewers in Step 7a produce `APPROVED`. After any fixer push triggered by Step 7 (external reviewers), re-run Step 7a (all internal reviewers) to ensure the stage-specific internal review gate is still clean — **unless the push qualifies as a trivial fix** (see "Trivial-fix skip rule" below).

### Trivial-fix skip rule

The trivial-fix skip rule applies in two distinct contexts within the orchestration loop:

**Context A — Pass 2 internal review (implementation PRs only)**: When a reviewer returns `NEEDS REVISION` on Pass 2 during Step 7a, the fixer applies a fix and pushes. If the fix is trivial (all three conditions below), the orchestrator skips the Pass 1 re-run and restarts from Pass 2 only. See the two-pass outcome table above.

**Context B — Step 7 fixer pushes (all PR types)**: When Step 7 (external reviewers) dispatches a fixer agent and the agent pushes a fix commit, the orchestrator normally re-runs Step 7a in full before proceeding. If the fix is trivial, the orchestrator skips the full Step 7a re-run and proceeds directly to Step 7. For implementation PRs, "full Step 7a re-run" means running both Pass 1 and Pass 2 again.

**Trivial-fix classification**: A fixer push qualifies as trivial if and only if **all** of the following conditions hold:

1. The fixer agent self-certifies that its changes are non-structural by including the phrase `TRIVIAL_FIX: non-structural` in its commit message or in its response to the orchestrator.
2. The diff contains **only** changes to plain text in string literals, comments, documentation prose, or inline numeric values — no logic, no control-flow, no added/removed function or variable declarations, no new imports, no structural markup changes (e.g., adding/removing table columns or list items in a protocol document).
3. The number of lines changed (additions + deletions) is 10 or fewer across the entire commit.

**When all three conditions are met (Context B)**: skip the Step 7a re-run and proceed directly to Step 7 (re-run the external automated reviewers on the new push). Post a one-line PR comment noting the skip:

> `Step 7a re-run skipped: fixer push classified as trivial (non-structural, ≤10 lines). Proceeding directly to Step 7.`

**When any condition is not met (Context B)**: re-run Step 7a in full as normal before proceeding to Step 7.

**Orchestrator verification**: The orchestrator must not rely solely on the fixer's self-certification. Before skipping (in either context), independently verify conditions 2 and 3 by inspecting the diff:

```bash
# Count changed lines and check for structural changes
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --stat
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- .
```

If the diff includes any non-text change (e.g., new function, new import, changed conditional, structural markup change), override the fixer's self-certification and do not apply the trivial-fix skip.

**Scope of skip**: The initial Step 7a run (after a draft PR is opened) is always full and cannot be skipped. Step 7a re-runs triggered by Pass 1 findings (i.e., `internal_review_cycle > 0` for findings from Pass 1) are also never skipped.

## Step 7: Automated Reviewer Loop

If one or more automated code review platforms are configured (see [`integrations/pr-review-platform.md`](../integrations/pr-review-platform.md)), run this loop after **any push to a PR branch**. If no review platform is configured, set `REVIEWER_LOOP_SKIPPED_NO_PLATFORMS=true`, skip this step, and report `⏭️ skipped` in the Step 6 summary.

**Standalone use:** This step (and Step 8) can be run for a single PR without full orchestration — see [`93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`](93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md) and the `/run-reviewer-loop` command (Cursor) or `automated-reviewer-loop` agent (Claude Code) or `workflow-reviewer-loop` skill (Codex).

**Important — run in the foreground, to completion, in the same turn:** This rule has two distinct parts, and both failures are prohibited, not just one:

1. **Do not race ahead.** Do not run Step 7 in the background while proceeding to Step 8 without its result.
2. **Do not background-and-yield.** Do not start `pr-review-loop.sh` in the background and then **end your turn** to wait for it. A backgrounded process's completion notification is delivered to whatever dispatched *you* (the parent orchestrator, or a human) — never back to you. If you end your turn while the loop is still running in the background, you park permanently: not blocked, not escalated, not dead, just structurally unable to ever observe your own process finishing. A parked runner is indistinguishable from a terminated one from the outside, which means it will not be recovered automatically. Run Step 7 in the foreground, or if you must background it, keep polling it yourself **in the same turn** until it returns. The review loop can take several minutes (poll interval × wait for bot); that is expected — stay with it. Only when the script exits with `clean` or `skipped`, observed by you in-turn, may you continue to Step 8.
3. **Never launch a second `pr-review-loop.sh` for the same PR while one is already running.** The script holds a per-PR single-instance lock; a concurrent invocation exits `75` with `REASON=lock_contention` and reports nothing about the PR's actual review state. If you are re-entering this step after a backgrounded or interrupted run (including after a compaction or a fresh session resuming this item), do not start a new invocation to "check." Poll for the earlier process to finish, or confirm via the lock file / process table that it is genuinely gone, and read the outcome from PR state directly (`gh pr view`, the reviewer-loop summary comment, the GraphQL review-thread query). Reserve `pr-review-loop.sh unlock <pr-number>` for a confirmed-stale lock (recorded PID no longer alive) — never as a way to run two instances at once. See the "Execution Discipline" section above the Step 0 heading for the general foreground/poll rule this specializes.

The helper script evaluates configured platforms sequentially. For each platform it checks for **existing** blocking findings from the bot (e.g. from a review that already ran on PR open) before posting a new trigger. If it finds any, it exits with `needs_fixes` without moving on to later platforms — so the fixer addresses them first; after a push, the next run starts again from the first configured platform. Supported platforms include `greptile`, `devin`, `coderabbit`, and `codex-github` (Codex GitHub App — async bot reviewer handled deterministically by `pr-review-loop.sh`).

> **CodeRabbit silence patterns**: CodeRabbit occasionally does not respond after a push — either because reviews are auto-paused after many commits ("Reviews paused" comment) or because it silently fails to auto-trigger. `pr-review-loop.sh` handles both cases automatically by posting `@coderabbitai review`. If the loop appears stalled with no CodeRabbit activity, see the [CodeRabbit silence patterns section in Protocol 93](93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md#coderabbit-silence-patterns) for diagnostic steps and escalation criteria before intervening manually.

Initialize `cycle = 0` once per orchestration run for the PR. Increment `cycle` each time a fixer agent is dispatched. Do not reset `cycle` after a fixer push; escalate when the run reaches `max_cycles`.

**`pr-review-loop.sh` now enforces this per-run cap itself (issue #1502), independent of whether the orchestrator's own `cycle` variable is tracked correctly — but only when the script can tell which invocations belong to the same run.** Before the first `pr-review-loop.sh` invocation for this PR in this orchestration run, generate a stable run identifier (any sufficiently unique string, e.g. `"run-$(date +%s)-$$"`) and `export PR_REVIEW_LOOP_RUN_ID=<that value>` for the remainder of this run. Reuse the exact same value across every re-invocation of `pr-review-loop.sh` for this PR within this run — including inline-fix retries (Step 7's fast lane) and subagent-dispatched fixer retries. Generate a **new** value only when a genuinely new orchestration run begins (a fresh session resuming this PR after a prior escalation, after human intervention, or after any gap in continuous execution). If `PR_REVIEW_LOOP_RUN_ID` is left unset, every invocation is treated by the script as its own isolated run and the per-run cap (`CYCLE_COUNT`/`MAX_CYCLES`) will not accumulate across cycles — the separate lifetime ceiling (`TOTAL_CYCLE_COUNT`/`MAX_TOTAL_CYCLES`, see `93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`) still enforces in that case, but the per-run cap's intended fast, specific signal is lost.

### PR feedback tracking and comments

Maintain a **PR feedback ledger** alongside the cycle counter. Each entry tracks:

| Field              | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`               | Sequential integer assigned in discovery order                               |
| `platform`         | Review platform name (e.g. `greptile`, `devin`)                              |
| `path`             | File path                                                                    |
| `line`             | Line number (display-only — can shift between commits)                       |
| `body_snippet`     | First 120 chars of the finding body (used as matching key — line-shift-safe) |
| `discovered_cycle` | Cycle when first seen                                                        |
| `status`           | `open` · `resolved` · `unresolved`                                           |
| `resolved_commit`  | Short SHA (set when resolved)                                                |

**Matching key**: `(platform, path, body_snippet)` — not line number, since lines shift after fixes. If a finding looks like a restatement of existing open PR feedback (same platform, same file, similar description), match it rather than creating a duplicate.

**Ledger updates:**

- After each review run with `needs_fixes`: parse `BLOCKING_N_*` output, add new entries or leave existing open ones unchanged.
- After each fixer push + re-review: any open entry whose key no longer appears in the new output is marked `resolved` with the fixer's commit SHA.
- When the loop terminates: any still-open entry is marked `unresolved`.

#### Commit SHA verification (mandatory before marking resolved)

Before recording a `resolved_commit` SHA in any ledger entry and before posting the fix commit comment, the agent **must** verify that the cited commit actually exists in the repository:

```bash
git log --oneline | grep "^<short_sha>"
# or equivalently:
git rev-parse --verify <short_sha> 2>/dev/null && echo "exists" || echo "not found"
```

If the SHA is not found in `git log`, the agent must **not** record it as the `resolved_commit` and must **not** claim the finding is resolved. Instead, the agent must commit any staged or unstaged changes first, obtain the real commit SHA from `git log`, and then record that SHA:

```bash
# If changes exist but were never committed:
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "<commit message>"
REAL_SHA=$(git log --oneline -1 | awk '{print $1}')
```

**Rationale**: An agent may edit files in a worktree and mentally track a planned commit SHA without ever running `git commit`. Recording a non-existent SHA in the ledger produces an audit trail that cannot be verified, misleads human reviewers who inspect the commit history, and can cause the PR to be labeled `ready-for-human-review` with uncommitted fixes. The verification step is the only reliable guard against this class of error.

**Escalation if commit fails**: If `git commit` fails (e.g., due to a pre-commit hook or empty diff), the agent must investigate and resolve the failure before marking any finding resolved. Do not silently skip the commit and record a fabricated SHA.

#### Fix commit comment

Post via `gh pr comment` immediately after updating the ledger following a fixer push:

```markdown
### Automated Fix: commit `<short_sha>`

Addressed **N** finding(s) from cycle M:

| #   | Platform | File            | Description               |
| --- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1   | greptile | `src/foo.ts:42` | First 80 chars of body... |

<details><summary>Remaining open findings: K</summary>

| #   | Platform | File           | Description               |
| --- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 3   | greptile | `src/baz.ts:5` | First 80 chars of body... |

</details>
```

If 0 findings were resolved: post a shorter note — "Pushed fixes for cycle M. 0 findings resolved so far — re-running review to check."

#### Resolve inline review comments

After each fixer push, reply to each addressed inline review comment on the PR to mark it as resolved. Use `gh api` to post a reply to each comment whose ledger entry transitioned to `resolved`:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr_number>/comments/<comment_id>/replies" \
  -f body="Fixed in commit \`<short_sha>\`."
```

This is **mandatory** — do not skip this step. Unresolved inline comments cause confusion when humans review the PR on GitHub, even if the underlying issue was already fixed. When delegating to a fixer subagent, include explicit instructions to reply to each addressed comment.

#### Final summary comment (script-owned for `clean` and `escalate`)

**`pr-review-loop.sh` automatically posts an "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" PR comment on `clean`, `needs_fixes`, and `escalate` exits.** You do not need to post this comment manually for those exit paths. The comment body matches the regex used by `workflow-next-action.sh` and the Step 8c verification gate:

```
Automated Reviewer Loop Summary|Reviewer Loop Summary|No blocking PR feedback
```

The script updates the summary in place on `needs_fixes` exits, including non-terminal fix cycles, so stale clean summaries cannot mask active reviewer findings. `skipped` exits (no platforms configured) do not post a summary comment.

The script-posted comment format:

```markdown
### Automated Reviewer Loop Summary

**Result:** clean — no blocking findings | escalated (reason) | max cycles reached — N blocking finding(s) unresolved
**Platforms:** greptile, devin
**Findings:** N blocking, N suggestions
**Ready reviewer phase:** No net-new blocker was found after the draft GitHub gate.
**Ready-phase platforms:** haystack

_Posted automatically by `pr-review-loop.sh`._
```

**Mandatory readiness order:** a Work Item Runner must never apply
`ready-for-human-review` immediately after Step 7a or immediately after opening
the PR. The only valid path to `ready-for-human-review` is:

1. Step 7a internal review gate completes successfully.
2. Step 7 external automated reviewer loop runs to a terminal `clean` or
   allowed `skipped` result. When Step 7 is not skipped, it leaves the automated
   reviewer loop summary comment on the PR. When Step 7 is skipped because no
   review platforms are configured, carry `REVIEWER_LOOP_SKIPPED_NO_PLATFORMS=true`
   into Step 8a so the summary check can verify the explicit skip reason. When
   Step 7 ran, carry its `POST_CLEAN_*` settle fields into Step 8a as well (see
   "Carry the settle verdict forward" in Step 7): Check 0.6 refuses a clean
   verdict that was never settled, and Step 8a.1 sizes its re-check from those
   fields instead of from a number of its own (issue #1574).
3. When Step 7 followed a fixer push or review-feedback cycle, the runner
   re-issues the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query before Step 7b, as described in
   "Re-query reviewThreads after each push" below.
4. Step 7b applies and verifies `ready-for-regression` for implementation PRs.
5. Step 8 CI loop returns green.
6. Step 8a readiness checklist passes, including the reviewer-loop summary
   check, documentation-stage alignment for `spec/*` and
   `implementation-plan/*` PRs, residual gate for applicable broad-scope work,
   and GraphQL `reviewThreads` gate.

Skipping any step above is a protocol violation. If an item-orchestrator or
stage agent returns with `ready-for-human-review` already applied before the
sequence is complete, remove that label, add `needs-fixes`, and resume from the
earliest skipped gate in this sequence. For example: resume at Step 7a when no
internal review summary exists, Step 7 when no clean/skipped automated reviewer
loop result exists, Step 7b when an implementation PR is missing
`ready-for-regression`, Step 8 when CI has not been re-run after the latest
label or push, or Step 8a when the final readiness checklist was skipped.

### Draft GitHub gate before ready-phase reviewers

When `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` contains `review.on_ready.github`, run the external
reviewer loop in two PR lifecycle phases:

Run the reviewer loop in two phases: keep the PR as draft and run
`review.on_draft.github` platforms (`--draft-github-only`) until they are clean,
then convert to non-draft with `gh pr ready` and run the full loop so
`review.on_ready.github` platforms see a clean-gated ready PR. The legacy
`--pre-after-clean-only` flag remains accepted as an alias for
`--draft-github-only` during the transition release. For the full runbook and
`READY_PHASE_*` telemetry details, see the **"Draft GitHub gate before
ready-phase reviewers"** section in
[`93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`](93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md).

After running the helper script (it reads `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` for the platform list automatically):

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh <pr_number> --branch <branch_name>
```

**Carry the settle verdict forward.** The loop does not merely report `clean`;
since issue #1556 it settles first — for CodeRabbit it waits for a *submitted*
review for the current HEAD and then for a quiet period — and reports how that
went in `POST_CLEAN_*` key=value lines. Step 8a consumes them (Check 0.6 and
Step 8a.1), so keep the loop output and export those lines into the
environment the checklist runs in. The values are plain tokens (digits, an
ISO-8601 timestamp, or a reason word); the pattern below admits nothing else:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Drop settle telemetry from any earlier invocation first. A loop that exits
# before emitting POST_CLEAN_* (outer timeout, interruption, API failure)
# must leave Check 0.6 with nothing — not with the previous HEAD's verdict.
for settle_var in $(env | grep -oE '^(POST_CLEAN|LOCAL_AI)_[A-Z_]*' || true); do
  unset "$settle_var"
done
loop_out="$(mktemp)"
loop_status=0
./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh <pr_number> --branch <branch_name> > "$loop_out" 2>&1 || loop_status=$?
cat "$loop_out"
if [ "$loop_status" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Reviewer loop exited ${loop_status}: act on its RESULT=/REASON= lines (needs_fixes, escalate, ...). Do not enter Step 8a on this run."
else
  settle_kv="$(mktemp)"
  grep -E '^(POST_CLEAN|LOCAL_AI)_[A-Z_]+=[A-Za-z0-9:_-]*$' "$loop_out" > "$settle_kv" || true
  while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
    export "$key=$value"
  done < "$settle_kv"
fi
```

Re-export after every invocation: a fixer cycle re-runs the loop, and the
settle fields belong to the latest HEAD only — which is why the block clears
them before running and exports nothing on a non-zero exit. A new session that
cannot produce them re-runs Step 7 rather than guessing (Check 0.6 fails
closed).

Interpret the result as follows:

| Result                                  | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### PR-Agent "Possible Issue" advisory labels

When `pr-review-loop.sh` returns `RESULT=clean` with `ADVISORY_LABELS` containing
`Possible Issue` entries, PR-Agent flagged advisory concerns but no hard-blockers.
**No orchestrator action is required.** The script auto-acknowledges these findings
and exits clean. See `93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md` for the full advisory
label disposition rules.

**Step 7a summary (Internal Review Gate) is still agent-owned.** The script-posted summary covers Step 7 (external automated reviewers) only. The Step 7a summary comment (`### Step 7a Internal Review Gate Summary`) must still be posted by the orchestrator/agent after the internal review gate completes. Do not conflate the two: they serve different verification purposes and are checked by different gates.

### Re-query reviewThreads after each push (mandatory)

**After every push that addresses reviewer feedback — including the push that causes `pr-review-loop.sh` to return `clean` — you MUST NOT apply `ready-for-human-review` before the GraphQL `reviewThreads` pre-Check-4 gate in Step 8a runs and passes.**

Do not rely on thread state observed before the push, and do not rely on the reviewer loop script's exit code as a thread-resolution signal. Bot reviewers (CodeRabbit, Devin, or any configured platform) may open new review threads within seconds of a push landing. Thread state cached from before the push will not include these new threads.

The required sequence after each fixer push is:

1. Push the fix commit.
2. Run `pr-review-loop.sh` (wait for bot response and poll for `clean` / `needs_fixes`).
3. **Re-issue the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query** (the same query in Step 8a's pre-Check-4 gate) to get the current thread state for the latest push.
4. If new unresolved threads are found: treat this as `needs_fixes` — handle them (dispatch a fixer or resolve via reply), then repeat from step 1.
5. Only when the re-issued query returns no unresolved bot-authored threads: proceed to Step 7b (implementation PRs) then Step 8.

**This check is not optional and cannot be skipped, even when the review loop script reported `clean`.** The script checks review state (blocking inline comments and `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews), not the resolved/unresolved state of `reviewThreads`. New threads created by a push may appear after the script's poll window closes. The GraphQL query is the only authoritative source for thread resolution state.

> **Critical — `clean` does not mean threads are resolved**: The reviewer loop script (`pr-review-loop.sh`) classifies some CodeRabbit findings as advisory/non-blocking and exits `clean` without requiring those threads to be marked resolved. An agent that equates `RESULT=clean` with "all threads resolved" will apply `ready-for-human-review` while unresolved threads remain on the PR. Always treat the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query result as the sole authoritative signal for thread resolution state — never the script exit code.

### Blocking vs. suggestion classification

When an automated review platform returns inline comments, classify them before deciding whether the PR needs fixes.

- Treat a comment as a **soft suggestion** only when every non-empty, non-code line starts with an advisory prefix such as `Consider`, `You might`, `An alternative`, `Optionally`, `It could be cleaner to`, `Perhaps`, `Maybe`, `You could`, `One option is`, or `Alternatively`.
- Treat any other inline comment as **blocking**.
- Treat `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews from any automated reviewer as **blocking**. Treat `COMMENTED` reviews from Devin as **blocking** when the body starts with `**Devin Review**` OR when the review is accompanied by unresolved inline PR review comments from `devin-ai-integration[bot]`; a `COMMENTED` Devin review is non-blocking only when neither condition holds. For other platforms, `COMMENTED` reviews are not automatically blocking. See `93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md` for full Devin blocking classification rules.

Soft suggestions may be reported in summaries, but they do not change the loop result to `needs_fixes`. Any blocking finding does.

### Inline fix rule (attempt before sub-agent dispatch)

Before dispatching a fixer sub-agent, check whether ALL blocking findings are **mechanical** — meeting every one of these criteria:

1. **Single file across the batch**: all blocking findings reference the **same single file** (one file total across the batch — not one file per finding). If two findings name two different files, the inline path does not apply; dispatch a sub-agent.
2. **Fully described**: each finding's body completely and unambiguously specifies the change (e.g., "replace `grep '^\s*'` with `grep '^[[:space:]]*'`", "add `--limit 100` to the `gh issue list` call", "remove the `states:OPEN` argument").
3. **Small scope**: the total estimated change across all blocking findings is ≤ 5 lines.

**When ALL criteria are met — apply the fixes directly** in the current session using Edit/Bash tools:

1. If `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`, complete the pre-mutation isolation self-check above
   before any inline edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation, or
   tracker mutation. Stop before mutation if the check fails.
2. Apply every blocking finding in one pass. For substantial fixer work, create
   coherent local checkpoint commits after completed logical sub-parts so
   partial progress survives runner interruption.
3. Push once after all addressable fixes for the current reviewer-loop cycle
   are complete. Do not push after each individual fix or checkpoint commit.
   Use descriptive commit messages for the final local commit sequence.
   _(Push before resolving threads — if push fails, threads must not be falsely
   marked resolved.)_
4. Reply to each finding's review thread with the fix description and commit SHA.
5. Resolve each addressed thread via the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation.
6. **Increment `cycle`** (the same counter used in the sub-agent loop). Inline fix retries are bounded by `max_cycles` exactly like sub-agent retries — the inline path is a faster lane, not an unbounded one.
7. Run `pr-review-loop.sh` again from the top of Step 7. If it returns `clean`, proceed normally. If the loop still reports unresolved blocking findings **and** `cycle >= max_cycles`, escalate to human (the just-pushed fix is always given a chance to be verified before escalating).

**Do not dispatch a sub-agent for mechanical findings.** Sub-agent startup overhead (context loading, planning) typically costs 10–20 minutes for changes that take 30 seconds to apply directly.

**When ANY criterion fails** — fall through to the sub-agent dispatch path below. The inline path is a fast lane, not a mandatory gate. When in doubt about whether a finding is fully described or single-file, dispatch the sub-agent.

**Fixing agent by PR branch type:**

| PR branch prefix                                  | Compatibility fixer to dispatch when direct fixes are needed |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spec/*`                                          | `spec-reviewer`                                              |
| `implementation-plan/*`                           | `implementation-plan-reviewer`                               |
| `feature/*` / `refactor/*` / `fix/*` / `hotfix/*` | `code-reviewer`                                              |

**Fixer agent worktree isolation rule (mandatory for batch dispatch):**

When this Work Item Runner was dispatched as part of an explicit-list batch (`BATCH_CONTEXT=true`), all fixer agents dispatched from this step **must** receive `BATCH_CONTEXT=true` and the resolved `<worktree-path>` in their handoff. Fixer agents that run without these values will use main-repo absolute file paths in `Read`/`Edit`/`Write` calls while committing via the worktree git context — causing their changes to be written to the main working tree and left uncommitted on the integration branch instead of on the isolated feature branch.

Required fixer handoff values (batch dispatch only):

- `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`
- `WORKTREE_PATH=<resolved-absolute-worktree-path>` — the same path used when this item was first dispatched
- `EXPECTED_BRANCH=<branch>`
- `ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT=<artifact-owning-repo-root>`
- `APPROVED_BASE_BRANCH=<base-branch>`
- `MUTATION_CLASSIFICATION=mutating`
- `isolation: "worktree"`
- The explicit branch-skip instruction: "BATCH_CONTEXT=true — the worktree is already on branch `<branch>`. Do NOT run `git checkout develop`, `git checkout -b`, `git switch`, `git reset`, or `git restore` from the main repo root."

**Fixer agent batching rule (mandatory):**

When dispatching a fixer agent, include the following explicit instruction:

> **Critical batching rule**: Do NOT address findings one-by-one with a separate push after each fix. Reviewer bots (e.g. Devin) start a new review cycle within 5–8 minutes of each push. If you push before all addressable fixes are done, the reviewer will start re-reviewing stale state while you are still working — creating a "one cycle behind" loop that can spin for dozens of cycles.
>
> Required sequence for every fixer dispatch:
>
> 1. **Read ALL blocking findings first** — before touching any file, collect the complete list of open blocking findings from the current review cycle.
> 2. **Apply ALL addressable fixes** — implement every fix you can address in this dispatch, across all files.
> 3. **Use local checkpoint commits when useful** — for substantial fixer work,
>    create coherent local checkpoint commits after completed logical sub-parts
>    so partial progress survives runner interruption.
> 4. **Push once after all addressable fixes** — push only after all addressable
>    fixes for the current reviewer-loop cycle are complete. Do not push after
>    each individual fix or checkpoint commit.
>
> Findings that cannot be addressed in this dispatch (e.g. require a human decision, are out of scope, or are genuinely contradictory) should be noted and left for human review. Do not skip a push just because one finding is unresolvable — push the rest.

### Attempt-context injection rule (Step 7 fixer dispatch)

This rule governs what the orchestrator prepends to the fixer agent's prompt on each
dispatch. It applies to fixer agents dispatched from this step only (Step 7 external
automated reviewers); Step 7a (internal review gate) fixer cycles are unaffected.

**First dispatch (cycle = 1)**

No attempt-context prefix is added. The fixer receives only the standard
blocking-findings list and the batching rule above.

**Retry dispatches (cycle ≥ 2)**

Before dispatching the fixer, the orchestrator prepends an attempt-context header
to the fixer's prompt using the following format:

> Attempt N/M: prior attempt(s) tried [per-attempt summaries]. The following findings
> remain open: [standard blocking-findings list]. Try a different approach for each
> remaining finding.

Where:

- `N` = the current `cycle` value (matches the loop's `cycle` counter exactly)
- `M` = `max_cycles` (the loop escalation limit — default: 10)
- `[per-attempt summaries]` = one entry per prior dispatch, each one-to-two plain-language
  sentences describing what that attempt changed and which findings it addressed or left
  open. Derive each entry from the PR feedback ledger and the fixer's commit message /
  response for that cycle.
- `[standard blocking-findings list]` = the same findings list passed in any dispatch —
  the attempt-context prefix does not replace it

**Accumulating summaries across retries**

For cycle N, include summaries for all N-1 prior attempts, not only the most recent.
Each entry should be keyed to its cycle number for clarity:

> Attempt 1: rewrote the `foo()` function signature in `bar.sh`; MD009 trailing-space
> finding on line 42 remained open.
> Attempt 2: removed trailing space on line 42; `relative-links` finding on `baz.md`
> remained open.

**Fallback when no prior-attempt summary is available**

If no summary was recorded for a prior attempt (e.g., the fixer did not respond or
the attempt had no ledger entries), use the minimal fallback:

> Attempt N/M: prior attempt did not fully resolve all findings. Try a different approach.

**Reappearance notation**

When a finding that was marked `resolved` in a prior cycle reappears in the current
ledger (same `(platform, path, body_snippet)` key, status reverted to `open`), the
per-attempt summary for the cycle in which it was "resolved" must note the reappearance:

> Attempt 2: removed trailing space on line 42 (fix did not hold — finding reappeared
> in cycle 3).

**In-session state only**

Attempt summaries live in the orchestrator's in-session state for the duration of the
PR's review loop. They are not persisted to disk or to any external tracker. They are
discarded when the orchestration session ends.

## Step 7b: Regression Label (Implementation PRs Only)

After Step 7 completes with result `clean` or `skipped`, and **before** entering Step 8, apply the `ready-for-regression` label on implementation PRs to trigger configured real regression CI checks, or an explicitly enabled placeholder regression workflow.

**Applies to**: PRs on branches `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`, `backport/hotfix/*`
**Does not apply to**: PRs on branches `spec/*`, `implementation-plan/*`, or graduation PRs (`develop-<slug>` → `develop`) — see the label derivation table in Step 8a for the graduation PR exemption (BR-6)

> **`refactor/*` is not exempt**: `refactor/*` branches require `ready-for-regression` exactly like `fix/*` and `feature/*` branches. Refactors that reach `ready-for-human-review` without this label will bypass e2e/regression CI. Apply the label unconditionally for any `refactor/*` PR — do not infer exemption from the content of the refactor (e.g., "it's documentation-only" or "it changes no logic").

**`BATCH_CONTEXT=true` — this step is mandatory and must not be skipped in parallel dispatch**: When agents are dispatched with `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`, they follow a compressed execution path (worktree isolation, branch-skip rules, reduced context). Step 7b is a required step in that path and must be executed **between Step 7 and Step 8** without exception for **all** implementation branch types (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`, `backport/hotfix/*`). The orchestrator's Step 5.1 catches a missing label at the end of the batch, but the agent is the primary responsible party and must not rely on Step 5.1 as a fallback.

```bash
# Only for implementation PRs:
gh pr edit <pr_number> --add-label "ready-for-regression"
```

This label triggers the `e2e-regression.yml` workflow (or project-specific equivalents). The template placeholder remains inactive unless explicitly enabled; downstream real regression suites should keep this label gate when they replace the placeholder. Step 8's CI loop (`pr-ci-loop.sh`) will then naturally pick up configured e2e checks as part of its green/red polling via `statusCheckRollup`.

The `gh pr edit --add-label` command is idempotent — applying a label that already exists is a no-op. When the label is already present from a previous cycle, the `synchronize` event from the latest push will have already re-triggered the workflow.

Skip this step entirely for spec and plan PRs, and for graduation PRs (`develop-<slug>` → `develop`).

### Step 7b completion confirmation

After applying the label, **verify it was applied successfully** before proceeding to Step 8:

```bash
# Verify ready-for-regression label is present (implementation PRs only):
gh pr view <pr_number> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name' | grep -q "^ready-for-regression$" && echo "✅ Step 7b complete: ready-for-regression label verified"
```

If the verification fails (label not present), do not proceed to Step 8. Re-run the `gh pr edit --add-label` command and verify again. This confirmation is required — Step 8a will block on a missing label and force a CI loop re-run, wasting cycles.

See [`integrations/e2e-regression.md`](../integrations/e2e-regression.md) for the full integration guide, including downstream customization.

## Step 8: CI Loop

**Guardrails check — delegated merge gate**: After the CI loop and readiness
checks complete (Step 8a), before merging, apply the delegated merge gate from
`guardrails-enforcement.md` section 3 Gate 5. When `stages.<stage>.may_merge_pr`
is `true` in the effective guardrails, assemble the evidence object and run:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/run-epic-risk-classifier.sh \
  --pr <pr-number> --max-risk <stages.<stage>.max_merge_risk>

./scripts/development-workflow/run-epic-delegated-gate.sh --input <evidence-file>
```

**Security-sensitive advisory evidence (BR8, BR9, AC8, AC9)**: the assembled
evidence file must include `.securityAdvisories[]` (the reconciled tracker
output from `security-advisory-tracker.sh reconcile`) and
`.securityAdvisoryDecisionEvents[]` (raw candidate decision-comment
references) identically whether the caller is `/run-item`, `/run-items`, or
`/run-epic` — this requirement is not conditioned on a resolved `/run-epic`
scope and is evaluated as part of the gate's normal reasons cascade, not a
new short-circuit. When any `.securityAdvisories[]` entry's reconciled
status is `pending`, `run-epic-delegated-gate.sh` returns `decision:
"human_required"` with a `security_sensitive_advisory_pending` reason and
blocks delegated merge regardless of `mode`, `may_merge_pr`, or unrelated
checkpoint state (see the "Security-sensitive advisory classification"
subsection of [`93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`](93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md)
for how that evidence is produced, and the `security-advisory-decision-required`
label that mirrors it on the PR itself).

Merge through the normal repository path only when the gate returns
`merge_allowed` **and** every required-evidence check in section 3 Gate 5 of
`guardrails-enforcement.md` passes. If the gate reports
`exceptional_bypass_authorized`, do not treat it as normal delegated merge
authority: follow the canonical exceptional-bypass policy in
[`guardrails-enforcement.md`](../guardrails-enforcement.md) Gate 5, immediately verify
the live PR state, and update the same audit marker with `merged` or `failed`.
Any head SHA, fingerprint, CI, reviewer, or check-state drift returns to Gate 5
for fresh authorization. For medium-risk decisions, include a complete "why safe
to merge" explanation. A risk classified above the stage `max_merge_risk` stops
the run and names the `high_risk_change` guardrail.

After readiness, branch on the effective merge authority:

- `merge_granted` (`stages.<stage>.may_merge_pr: true`, or an accepted
  invocation override such as `--may-merge` within the resolved guardrails):
  `ready-for-human-review` and `ready-for-regression` are intermediate
  readiness evidence. Continue through the delegated merge gate and approved
  merge path for the in-scope PR. Do not report the item terminal while it is
  merely ready unless a named post-readiness gate blocks merge.
- `merge_denied` (`stages.<stage>.may_merge_pr: false`, `--no-may-merge`, or no
  delegated merge authority): do not execute merge commands. Report
  `ready_human_merge`, leave the PR at the human handoff, and name the exact
  denying policy value plus the next human action.

If merge authority is granted but a named post-readiness gate fails, report
`merge_blocked` with the failed gate and human action. If this runner stops at
readiness in a merge-granted run without a named blocker, the terminal outcome
is `policy_inconsistent`, not ready or done.

When the gate returns `merge_allowed`, the item run does **not** stop at
`ready-for-human-review`. Continue through the repository-approved merge path,
verify GitHub reports the PR as `MERGED`, delete or prune the merged branch as
appropriate, run `post-merge-cleanup.sh` for the correct base branch, and perform
the live tracker verification described in Step 10 before reporting the item
terminal.

**Only after Step 7 (and Step 7b for implementation PRs) has completed**, wait for required checks to settle.

**Same foreground rule as Step 7 applies here.** Do not start `pr-ci-loop.sh` in the background and end your turn to wait for it — the completion notification is delivered to your dispatcher, not to you, and ending your turn while it runs parks you permanently, indistinguishable from a dead runner. Run it in the foreground, or poll it yourself in the same turn until it returns a terminal result.

Prefer the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh <pr_number>
```

If a local watch/poll command exits before GitHub has reached a final state,
treat that as an incomplete observation, not as a terminal item state. Re-query
`gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup,labels,isDraft,headRefOid`,
ignore superseded duplicate runs that are cancelled or skipped in favor of newer
checks for the same head SHA, and re-run `pr-ci-loop.sh` whenever required
checks are still pending/queued or the regression label was just applied. A
same-session runner must continue the Step 8 loop until the helper returns
`green`, `red`, or `timeout`; only `red` and `timeout` trigger the actions in the
table below.

Interpret the result as follows:

| Result    | Action                                                                                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `green`   | Proceed to Step 8a (label readiness checklist) → Step 8b (tracker status) → Step 8c (independent verification) |
| `red`     | Apply `needs-fixes`, dispatch the matching fixer agent, wait for a push, then return to Step 7                 |
| `timeout` | Escalate to human; do not apply `ready-for-human-review`                                                       |

## Step 8a: Label Readiness Checklist (Hard Gate)

**Before applying `ready-for-human-review`**, verify all required readiness conditions are met. This is a hard gate — do not skip or defer.

> **Warning — `pr-review-loop.sh clean` does NOT authorize applying `ready-for-human-review`**: A `clean` exit from the reviewer loop script means no blocking inline comments or `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews were detected. It does NOT mean all review threads are resolved. The GraphQL `reviewThreads` pre-Check-4 gate below (exit code 4) is the only authoritative check for thread resolution state. Agents that skip this gate and apply the label based solely on the script's `clean` result will leave unresolved bot-authored threads on the PR. Run this checklist in full every time — including the GraphQL pre-Check-4 gate — regardless of what Step 7 reported.

### Exit code contract

| Exit Code | Meaning                                                                                          | Action                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | PR is ready (CI green, non-draft, regression label verified for implementation PRs, no unresolved threads) | Apply `ready-for-human-review`               |
| 1         | PR is still in draft                                                                             | Run `gh pr ready` first                             |
| 2         | `ready-for-regression` label applied this run                                                    | Re-run Step 8 (pr-ci-loop.sh) before returning here |
| 3         | `ready-for-regression` label missing at pre-Check-4 gate                                         | Apply label, re-run Step 8                          |
| 4         | Unresolved review threads at pre-Check-4 gate                                                    | Resolve threads, push fixes, re-run checklist       |
| 5         | CI not green at readiness gate                                                                    | Run Step 8 (pr-ci-loop.sh) and fix failing checks   |
| 6         | Late-arriving review threads detected after label application                                     | Remove `ready-for-human-review`, add `needs-fixes`, return to Step 7a |
| 7         | Latest reviewer-loop summary is missing or has a non-clean terminal result                       | Do not label ready; escalate or return to reviewer loop |
| 8         | Documentation-stage alignment mismatch on `spec/*` or `implementation-plan/*` PR                 | Remove stale readiness, add/update warning, add `needs-fixes`, correct or escalate |
| 9         | Residual gate missing, blocked, or escalated for broad-scope work                                | Keep out of readiness; fix residuals, add `needs-fixes`, or escalate |
| 10        | Documentation-stage alignment checker infrastructure failure                                     | Retry checker or resolve GitHub/diff read failure |
| 11        | Complex workflow decision-gate matrix evidence missing or contradictory when applicable          | Keep out of readiness; add `needs-fixes`, complete matrix evidence, and re-run review |
| 12        | Reviewer-loop clean verdict not settled (Check 0.6 / 0.6b): `POST_CLEAN_*` or `LOCAL_AI_*` fields absent, recheck suppressed, platform never submitted a review, settle window exhausted while the platform was active, `POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA` differs from the live PR head, or `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` is not exactly `1` when `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED=1` | Do not label ready; re-run Step 7, export its `POST_CLEAN_*` and `LOCAL_AI_*` fields, and re-enter Step 8a; a second consecutive `POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_TIMEOUT=1` escalates (`settle_never_quiet`) |

When adding a new gate to this checklist, allocate the next unused exit code and update this table. Exit codes must not collide.

> **Critical**: For implementation PRs (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`, `backport/hotfix/*`), you **must** confirm that `ready-for-regression` was applied in Step 7b **before** reaching this checklist. If it was not, apply it now (see Check 2 below) — do not proceed to `ready-for-human-review` without it. The orchestrator's Step 5.1 will catch and correct a missing `ready-for-regression` label, but the agent is the primary responsible party and must not rely on the orchestrator as a fallback.

### Label derivation rule

Required labels are determined by the **branch prefix**, not by the content of the PR (e.g., whether it changes code vs. documentation). An agent must never infer labels from what was changed inside the PR.

| Branch prefix                                    | Requires `ready-for-regression` | When to apply                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature/*`                                      | Yes                             | Step 7b (before Step 8); confirmed here in Step 8a Check 2                                                                                                      |
| `fix/*`                                          | Yes                             | Step 7b (before Step 8); confirmed here in Step 8a Check 2                                                                                                      |
| `refactor/*`                                     | Yes                             | Step 7b (before Step 8); confirmed here in Step 8a Check 2                                                                                                      |
| `hotfix/*`                                       | Yes                             | Step 7b (before Step 8); confirmed here in Step 8a Check 2                                                                                                      |
| `backport/hotfix/*`                              | Yes                             | Step 7b (before Step 8); confirmed here in Step 8a Check 2. See Protocol 03 Path 4 backport readiness steps.                                                    |
| `spec/*`                                         | No                              | —                                                                                                                                                                |
| `implementation-plan/*`                          | No                              | —                                                                                                                                                                |
| `develop-<slug>` (graduation PR, base `develop`) | No — explicitly exempt (BR-6)   | Graduation PRs carry no new implementation; label not required. Do not log the absence as a protocol deviation. See `05b-graduate-development-protocol.md` Step 4. |

Any branch that does not match a recognized prefix above — **other than graduation branches (`develop-<slug>` → `develop`, which are a known and expected non-implementation PR type)** — is treated as non-implementation (i.e., `ready-for-regression` is NOT required), but should be treated as a configuration anomaly and reported to the human.

### Infrastructure Dependency Scan (pre-readiness)

Before running the readiness checklist below, perform a best-effort scan of the PR diff to detect infrastructure dependencies that require human setup before the feature can be safely enabled. This scan runs on **every pass through Step 8a** — including after fixer pushes — so the label and PR body section always reflect the current diff (BR-6).

**Timing**: Run after CI is green and all automated reviewer loops are clean (Step 7 complete), but before applying `ready-for-human-review`. The scan result does **not** block readiness — `needs-setup` co-exists with `ready-for-human-review` (BR-3, BR-4).

**Scan procedure**:

1. Read the PR diff:

   ```bash
   gh pr diff <pr_number>
   ```

2. Scan the diff for infrastructure dependency signals on **added lines** (lines starting with `+`). The following heuristics are best-effort and intentionally incomplete (BR-9 — false negatives are acceptable):
   - **New environment variable references**: added lines matching patterns like `process.env.NEW_VAR`, `os.environ["NEW_VAR"]`, `$NEW_VAR` in shell scripts, or new entries added to `.env.example`, `.env.template`, or similar env-template files.
   - **New GitHub Actions secret references**: added lines in `.github/workflows/**` files that reference `${{ secrets.NEW_SECRET }}`.
   - **New config key additions to environment-specific config files**: added keys in files named `*.env`, `.env.*`, `config/production.*`, or similar deployment-configuration files.
   - **Explicit setup TODO comments added in the diff**: added comments containing phrases like `# TODO: set`, `# Set this to`, `# Required: configure`, or similar that indicate a value must be externally provided.

3. **If one or more signals are found**:

   a. Construct a `## Pre-merge Setup` section listing each detected requirement with (BR-8):
   - Requirement name
   - Type (e.g., environment variable, GitHub Actions secret, DNS record, service account token)
   - Plain-language description of the expected value
   - Where to set it (e.g., GitHub Actions secrets, Railway environment, DNS provider)

   b. Replace any existing `## Pre-merge Setup` section in the PR body with the newly constructed one, then update the PR body. This step runs on every pass through Step 8a (including after fixer pushes), so the section must always reflect the current diff — never accumulate stale or duplicate sections:

   ```bash
   # Remove any existing ## Pre-merge Setup block (from header to next ## heading or EOF),
   # then append the updated block at the end of the cleaned body.
   CURRENT_BODY=$(gh pr view <pr_number> --json body --jq '.body')
   CLEANED_BODY=$(echo "$CURRENT_BODY" | python3 -c "
   import sys, re
   body = sys.stdin.read()
   # Remove existing ## Pre-merge Setup section (from the heading to next ## heading or end of string)
   body = re.sub(r'\n## Pre-merge Setup\n.*?(?=\n## |\Z)', '', body, flags=re.DOTALL)
   print(body.rstrip())
   ")
   UPDATED_BODY="${CLEANED_BODY}

   ## Pre-merge Setup
   <requirements list>"
   gh pr edit <pr_number> --body "$UPDATED_BODY"
   ```

   c. Apply the `needs-setup` label (BR-1 — the label must always accompany the section):

   ```bash
   gh pr edit <pr_number> --add-label "needs-setup"
   ```

   **Note**: The `needs-setup` GitHub label must exist in the repository's label settings before this step can succeed. Suggested color: `#fbca04` (yellow). If the label does not exist, create it in the repository's **Issues → Labels** settings first.

4. **If no signals are found**:

   Ensure `needs-setup` is not present and no `## Pre-merge Setup` section exists in the PR body. If either is present from a prior scan (e.g., a previous commit introduced an env var that has since been removed), remove them:

   ```bash
   # Remove label only if it is currently present (avoids silencing real API/auth errors)
   HAS_SETUP_LABEL=$(gh pr view <pr_number> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name' | grep -c "^needs-setup$" || true)
   if [ "$HAS_SETUP_LABEL" -gt 0 ]; then
     gh pr edit <pr_number> --remove-label "needs-setup"
   fi

   # Remove the ## Pre-merge Setup section from the PR body if present
   # (Read body, strip the section and all content until the next ## heading or EOF, write back)
   CURRENT_BODY=$(gh pr view <pr_number> --json body --jq '.body')
   CLEANED_BODY=$(echo "$CURRENT_BODY" | python3 -c "
   import sys, re
   body = sys.stdin.read()
   body = re.sub(r'\n## Pre-merge Setup\n.*?(?=\n## |\Z)', '', body, flags=re.DOTALL)
   print(body.rstrip())
   ")
   gh pr edit <pr_number> --body "$CLEANED_BODY"
   ```

5. After the scan: proceed to the readiness checklist below. The presence of `needs-setup` is a valid co-label with `ready-for-human-review` and does **not** block this checklist or prevent `ready-for-human-review` from being applied (BR-3). The checklist script does not check for or remove `needs-setup` — it is a deliberate signal, not a stale label.

### Human Checkpoint Label Sync (pre-readiness)

When the run carries an effective checkpoint policy (`checkpoints[]` on the epic
invocation policy or a `checkpoint-policy.json` file saved at policy selection
time), synchronize the `human-checkpoint-required` label and stable PR comment
**after** CI and automated review are clean and **before** applying
`ready-for-human-review`. This runs on every pass through Step 8a — including
after fixer pushes — so label state always reflects current checkpoint
satisfaction.

**Timing**: Run after the infrastructure dependency scan above, after CI and
reviewer-loop checks are clean, and before Check 4 (`ready-for-human-review`
application) in the readiness checklist. This sync step never applies
`ready-for-human-review` by itself; Check 4 is the only label-application path.

**Procedure**:

1. Resolve the linked work item number (`ITEM_NUMBER`) and branch name
   (`BRANCH`) for the PR.
2. Locate the effective checkpoint policy JSON array (from epic handoff metadata,
   `checkpoint-policy.json` in the run working directory, or
   `invocation_policy.effective_policy.checkpoints`).
3. Detect satisfaction from human signals and sync labels:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development-workflow/run-epic-checkpoint-lifecycle.sh sync-pr-labels \
     --pr "$PR_NUMBER" \
     --item "$ITEM_NUMBER" \
     --branch "$BRANCH" \
     --checkpoints-file checkpoint-policy.json \
     --write-checkpoints-file checkpoint-policy.json
   ```

4. When `BLOCKING_COUNT` is greater than zero, keep
   `human-checkpoint-required` and record checkpoint reason plus required human
   action in the `<!-- run-epic:checkpoint-status -->` comment posted by the
   script. Do **not** apply `ready-for-human-review` here. If CI, reviewers,
   documentation-stage alignment, residual gates, and review-thread checks all
   pass, Check 4 applies `ready-for-human-review`; the two labels may coexist
   per protocol 92 BR-11/BR-3.
5. When all applicable checkpoints are `satisfied` or `waived`, the script

### 8a.1: Late-Arriving Review Thread Re-check (Mandatory whenever a GitHub review platform is configured)

**When to run this substep:**

- After the label readiness checklist passes (all checks = exit 0)
- Before proceeding to Step 8b
- Whenever the effective `review.on_draft.github` or `review.on_ready.github`
  list (after any `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` override) is non-empty. Skip
  it only when Step 7 was `skipped` because no platform is configured, or
  when Check 0.6 reported `no_thread_posting_platforms`.

**Why this substep exists:**
Every GitHub review platform posts `reviewThreads` asynchronously, and not on
the same clock. The original race — `codex-github` posting a thread that was
already in flight when the checklist ran — is measured in seconds. CodeRabbit's
findings do not race the checklist at all; they arrive minutes later. Measured
on PR #1573: HEAD at 00:17:29, walkthrough comment at 00:18:17, formal review
with three findings at 00:30:32 — twelve minutes after the walkthrough. Across
PRs #1532, #1541, #1555, #1568, #1569 and #1570 the same pattern produced 2, 3,
5, 1, 3 and 8 late findings; every one was real, and on #1570 two were Major.
A fixed ten-second wait would have caught none of them. The wait therefore
belongs to the tool: `pr-review-loop.sh` settles before it reports `clean`
(issue #1556), and this substep reads that result rather than re-implementing
a wait of its own (issue #1574).

**Procedure:**

1. **Do not wait here — the loop already did, or the checklist already sent you back**:

   Check 0.6 refused every unsettled state before the label was applied:
   `POST_CLEAN_RECHECK` unset or suppressed, `POST_CLEAN_NO_SUBMITTED_REVIEW=1`,
   and `POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_TIMEOUT=1`. Elapsed time is not quiet time — a bot
   that edits its walkthrough mid-sleep and posts threads afterwards defeats any
   fixed sleep — and only the loop's activity-aware settle (quiet timer reset on
   every platform action) can tell the two apart. So what reaches this substep
   is one of:

   | Step 7 settle fields                                                                      | Action                                                                                                                                            |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `POST_CLEAN_SETTLED=1`                                                                   | Re-query now. The loop held the platform's quiet period after a submitted review; this re-query is the adjacency check Protocol 92 requires.       |
   | `POST_CLEAN_RECHECK=0` with `POST_CLEAN_RECHECK_SKIP_REASON=no_thread_posting_platforms` | Not applicable — no configured platform posts threads. Skip 8a.1.                                                                                 |

   This substep carries no wait and no number. If the loop output is not
   available in this session, the answer is to re-run Step 7 (Check 0.6
   enforces that), not to pick a wait.

2. **Re-query review threads**:

   Before running the query, resolve the Codex bot login. Use the value of `CODEX_GITHUB_BOT_LOGIN` if set; otherwise default to `"chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]"` (the default used by `codex-github-reviewer.sh`). Strip the `[bot]` suffix because GraphQL `author.login` values omit it:

   <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
   ```bash
   CODEX_BOT_LOGIN="${CODEX_GITHUB_BOT_LOGIN:-chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]}"
   # GraphQL author.login omits the "[bot]" suffix present in REST API logins; strip it.
   CODEX_BOT_LOGIN="${CODEX_BOT_LOGIN%\[bot\]}"
   ```

   <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
   ```bash
   JQ_FILTER="[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
         | select(.isResolved == false)
         | select((.isOutdated // false) == false)
         | select(.comments.nodes[0].author.login as \$a | [\"coderabbitai\",\"devin-ai-integration\",\"greptile-apps\",\"$CODEX_BOT_LOGIN\"] | index(\$a) != null)
         | select((.comments.nodes[0].body // \"\") | test(\"✅ Addressed\") | not)] | length"
   UNRESOLVED_RECHECK=$(gh api graphql -f query='
     query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
       repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
         pullRequest(number:$number) {
           reviewThreads(first: 100) {
             nodes { isResolved isOutdated comments(first: 1) { nodes { author { login } body } } }
           }
         }
       }
     }' -f owner="<owner>" -f repo="<repo>" -F number="$PR_NUMBER" \
     --jq "$JQ_FILTER")
   ```

3. **Handle late-arriving threads**:
   - If `$UNRESOLVED_RECHECK -gt 0`: New unresolved threads were discovered. Remove `ready-for-human-review`, add `needs-fixes`, and return to Step 7a to address them:
     <!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
     ```bash
     if [ "$UNRESOLVED_RECHECK" -gt 0 ]; then
       echo "⚠️ LATE-ARRIVING THREADS: Re-check detected $UNRESOLVED_RECHECK new unresolved review thread(s)."
       echo "Removing ready-for-human-review label and returning to Step 7a."
       gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$TARGET_REPO" --remove-label "ready-for-human-review"
       gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$TARGET_REPO" --add-label "needs-fixes"
       echo "Return to Step 7a to address the newly-discovered threads."
       exit 6  # Exit code 6 = "late-arriving review threads detected"
     fi
     ```
   - If `$UNRESOLVED_RECHECK -eq 0`: No new threads found. Continue to Step 8b.

**Note**: The re-query is cheap and is always the last thing before Step 8b. Anything lengthy between the loop's verdict and the label — a CI poll, a sibling merge, a session break — makes it the only check that is still current (`POST_CLEAN_SETTLED_AT` is the instant the verdict was established; the gap is measurable, not guessed). The author allowlist in the query already includes `coderabbitai`; the mechanism was never blind to CodeRabbit — only the fixed wait was mis-sized.

**Interpretation**:

- **All checks pass (exit 0)**: Continue to Step 8b (update tracker status) and then Step 8c (independent PR verification); only report the PR as ready after Step 8c also passes
- **Any check fails**: Stop and fix the condition. Do not apply `ready-for-human-review` until all checks pass
  - If `PR is still a draft` (exit 1): Human error; run `gh pr ready <pr_number>` manually
  - If `missing ready-for-regression` on implementation PR (exit 2 from Check 2): The label has been applied by Check 2. **Do not continue to Check 3/4.** Re-run `pr-ci-loop.sh` (Step 8) first to wait for the e2e/regression workflow triggered by the label. Only re-enter Step 8a after CI is green again. This ensures the e2e/regression check completes before the PR is marked ready.
  - If `ready-for-regression not verified` on implementation PR (exit 3 from pre-Check-4 gate): Step 7b was not completed. Apply the label via Step 7b, run Step 8 (CI loop), and re-enter Step 8a from the beginning. This gate is a hard block — `ready-for-human-review` cannot be applied until `ready-for-regression` is verified present.
  - If `unresolved review threads found` (exit 4 from GraphQL pre-Check-4 gate): The GraphQL query returned unresolved bot-authored review threads. Address the findings, push fixes, and re-enter Step 8a from the beginning. This gate is a hard block — `ready-for-human-review` cannot be applied until the GraphQL query confirms all threads are resolved. **Do not rely on self-tracked thread state** — the GraphQL query is the authoritative check.
  - If `late-arriving review threads detected` (exit 6 from Step 8a.1 re-check): Unresolved review threads were discovered after the pre-Check-4 gate — a platform posted after the loop's verdict. Remove `ready-for-human-review`, add `needs-fixes`, and return to Step 7a.
  - If `reviewer-loop verdict not settled` (exit 12 from Check 0.6 / 0.6b): the latest Step 7 output is not in this environment, the loop's recheck was suppressed (`SKIP_POST_CLEAN_RECHECK`, `--compare`), the platform never submitted a review for this HEAD (`POST_CLEAN_NO_SUBMITTED_REVIEW=1`), the settle window ran out while the platform was still active (`POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_TIMEOUT=1`), the verdict describes a head the PR has moved past (`POST_CLEAN_HEAD_SHA` differs from the live head), `LOCAL_AI_CONFIGURED` was not carried forward, or `LOCAL_AI_HEAD_CURRENT` is not exactly `1` when `local-ai-reviewer` is configured. Do not apply `ready-for-human-review`. Re-run Step 7 for the current HEAD, export its `POST_CLEAN_*` and `LOCAL_AI_*` fields, and re-enter Step 8a from the beginning. If a second consecutive run reports `POST_CLEAN_SETTLE_TIMEOUT=1`, escalate to the human with reason `settle_never_quiet` rather than re-running again.
  - If `reviewer-loop summary missing or non-clean` (exit 7 from Check 0.5): The latest automated reviewer-loop summary comment is absent or its `Result:` line is not `clean`/`skipped`. Do not apply `ready-for-human-review`. For `RESULT=escalate`, `pending_timeout`, `timeout`, `needs_fixes`, or any other non-clean terminal result, escalate or re-enter Step 7 according to the reviewer-loop result.
  - If `documentation-stage alignment mismatch` (exit 8 from Check 3.6):
    the PR is on `spec/*` or `implementation-plan/*` but includes files outside
    the expected stage artifact allowlist, or has an empty diff. The checker
    posts or updates `<!-- documentation-stage-alignment -->`; keep
    `ready-for-human-review` removed, add `needs-fixes`, and correct the diff or
    escalate for a human workflow-stage decision.
  - If `residual gate missing, blocked, or escalated` (exit 9 from Check 3.5):
    the item is broad-scope but lacks a passing residual gate result. For
    `block`, apply or keep `needs-fixes` and finish the residuals, link
    follow-up issues, or mark residuals out of scope. For `escalate`, stop for
    the named human decision before readiness.
  - If `documentation-stage alignment checker infrastructure failure` (exit
    10): retry the checker or resolve the GitHub/diff read failure before
    applying `ready-for-human-review`.
  - If `needs-fixes` is present (Check 3): The label is stale at this point (CI is green and reviews are clean), so it is automatically removed before proceeding to apply `ready-for-human-review`

This checklist ensures the label sequence is always complete and all CI checks (including e2e/regression) have passed before the PR is declared ready for human review.

## Step 8b: Update Tracker Status

**Guardrails check — completion gate**: Before marking an item complete for a
stage (updating tracker status to `Spec in Review`, `Plan in Review`, or
`Development in Review`), apply the completion gate from `guardrails-enforcement.md`
section 3 Gate 6:

1. Confirm the stage outcome against **live state** — the PR status must be
   `MERGED` for stage-complete transitions, or the `ready-for-human-review`
   label must be present and verified for in-review transitions. Never infer
   completion from stale memory, branch names, or prior resolver output.
2. If `audit.pr_disposition_record` is `required` in the effective guardrails,
   confirm the PR disposition record has been written (or will be written
   immediately after) before setting the tracker status. If the audit record
   cannot be produced, apply the `missing_audit_evidence` stop condition.

After the label readiness checklist passes, update the tracker status to reflect the PR is waiting for human review:

- For **spec PRs** (`spec/*`): set tracker status to `Spec in Review`
- For **plan PRs** (`implementation-plan/*`): set tracker status to `Plan in Review`
- For **implementation PRs** (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`): set tracker status to `Development in Review`

### Routing: CLI vs. MCP

How to perform the update depends on the configured `issue_tracker.provider` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` and the execution context:

#### GitHub Projects (provider: `github_projects`) — use `gh` CLI

GitHub Projects status updates are fully supported via `gh` CLI and require no MCP server. Subagents in any execution context (including parallel batch runs) **must** use the CLI update pattern rather than MCP. Follow the "One-shot status update (recommended pattern)" section in [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/github-projects.md`](../integrations/github-projects.md) for the full commands and ID-resolution steps.

#### Other providers (Linear, Jira, etc.) — report and defer

For issue tracker providers that have no supported `gh`-equivalent CLI, MCP server access is required. Because MCP servers are not available in subagent execution contexts:

- **Subagents** must **not** attempt the tracker update directly. Instead, include the required transition in the summary returned to the orchestrator:

  ```
  TRACKER_UPDATE_REQUIRED: set issue #<N> status to "<target_status>"
  ```

- **The orchestrator** (or the human invoking the Work Item Runner directly) is responsible for performing the MCP-based status update after the subagent returns.

If neither the CLI path nor MCP is available, log a warning and continue — do not block labeling or PR readiness on a tracker update failure.

---

## Step 8c: Post-Label Independent Verification (Hard Gate)

After Steps 8a and 8b complete, perform one final independent verification of the actual PR state via `gh pr view` before reporting the PR as ready for human review. **Do not rely on prior step outputs or agent self-reports** — query GitHub directly.

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json baseRefName,isDraft,labels,statusCheckRollup,comments
```

For the `reviewThreads` resolution check, `gh pr view --json` does not expose `reviewThreads`; use the GraphQL API directly. **This query is mandatory — do not skip it or rely on self-tracked thread state:**

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->

```bash
CODEX_BOT_LOGIN="${CODEX_GITHUB_BOT_LOGIN:-chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]}"
CODEX_BOT_LOGIN="${CODEX_BOT_LOGIN%\[bot\]}"
BUGBOT_BOT_LOGIN="${BUGBOT_BOT_LOGIN:-cursor[bot]}"
BUGBOT_BOT_LOGIN="${BUGBOT_BOT_LOGIN%\[bot\]}"

gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
    repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
      pullRequest(number:$number) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes { isResolved isOutdated comments(first: 1) { nodes { author { login } body } } }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=<owner> -f repo=<repo> -F number=<pr_number> \
  | jq --arg codex_bot "$CODEX_BOT_LOGIN" --arg bugbot_bot "$BUGBOT_BOT_LOGIN" '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
        | select(.isResolved == false)
        | select((.isOutdated // false) == false)
        | select(.comments.nodes[0].author.login as $a | ["coderabbitai","devin-ai-integration","greptile-apps",$codex_bot,$bugbot_bot] | index($a) != null)
        | select((.comments.nodes[0].body // "") | test("✅ Addressed") | not)'
```

The bot login list above is a superset covering async review-bot platforms
supported by `pr-review-loop.sh` that may own GitHub review threads
(`coderabbit`, `devin`, `greptile`, `codex-github`, `bugbot`). The current
default GitHub reviewer config in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` uses
`review.on_draft.github: [local-ai-reviewer, pr-agent]` and
`review.on_ready.github: [bugbot]`; `local-ai-reviewer` and `pr-agent` do not
own a GitHub review-thread bot login in this workflow. Update the list if your
project uses different or additional review bots.

The output must contain no unresolved, non-outdated threads from configured bot reviewers (e.g. `coderabbitai`, `devin-ai-integration`, `chatgpt-codex-connector`) before this step passes. A thread is considered non-blocking when `isResolved: true`, `isOutdated: true`, or the first comment body contains `✅ Addressed` (CodeRabbit appends this when a fix commit lands). Any unresolved, non-outdated bot-authored thread that does not meet those conditions — regardless of severity, including Nitpick and Trivial — blocks this check. For PRs with more than 100 threads, implement cursor-based pagination: add `pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }` to the `reviewThreads` field selection, capture `endCursor` from each response, and repeat the query with `reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $cursor)` until `hasNextPage` is false.

Verify all of the following. If any check fails, **do not report ready** — treat it the same as `needs-fixes` and re-enter the fix loop from Step 7a:

| Check                                           | Pass condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If any check fails:

1. Log the specific failure(s) — include the PR number, failed check name, and observed value.
2. Apply `needs-fixes` if not already present: `gh pr edit <pr_number> --add-label "needs-fixes"`.
3. Remove `ready-for-human-review` if it was already applied: `gh pr edit <pr_number> --remove-label "ready-for-human-review"`.
4. Fix the root cause (wrong base branch, missing label, missing review comment, failing CI) and return to Step 7a.

Only after all checks pass should the Work Item Runner run
`item-completion-self-check.sh` for the claimed ready state. Include `--pr`,
`--expected-base`, `--expected-label ready-for-human-review`,
`--expected-label ready-for-regression` for implementation branches that require
Step 7b, `--forbid-label needs-fixes`, `--tracker-required true` when tracker
status is claimed, and both `--require-review-summary true` and
`--require-review-threads true` when Step 7 was configured. A helper
`discrepancy` result sends the runner back to the appropriate existing gate:
Step 7a for review findings, Step 8 for CI, Step 8a for labels/readiness, Step
8b for tracker state, or human escalation for unavailable required surfaces.
Only a passing self-check may be reported as terminal ("ready for human
review").

## Step 9: Feedback Loop

When a human requests changes on a PR:

1. Remove `ready-for-human-review`
2. Add `needs-fixes`
3. Address the feedback
4. Push fixes
5. For spec and plan PRs, verify the PR description still contains a current `Document Quality Gate` log
6. Run Step 7a (internal review gate) — all internal reviewers must approve before proceeding
7. Run Step 7 (external automated reviewers)
8. Run Step 7b (implementation PRs only)
9. Run Step 8 (CI loop)
10. Run Step 8a (label readiness checklist) — this is **mandatory** to verify the PR is non-draft, `ready-for-regression` is applied on implementation PRs, and `ready-for-human-review` is applied
11. Run Step 8b (update tracker status)
12. Run Step 8c (post-label independent verification) — query GitHub directly to confirm base branch, labels, review comment, and CI before reporting ready
13. Notify human that feedback has been addressed and the PR is ready again

See `92-pr-readiness-signal-protocol.md` for label definitions.

## Step 10: Post-Merge Status Transitions and Local Cleanup

When a human confirms that a PR has been merged, or when this runner merged a PR
through the delegated merge gate, update the issue tracker and clean up local
state according to this table:

| Merged PR branch type                             | Set tracker status to |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `spec/*`                                          | Spec Ready            |
| `implementation-plan/*`                           | Plan Ready            |
| `feature/*` / `fix/*` / `refactor/*` / `hotfix/*` | Merged                |

**A PR may resolve more than one item** (#1391). `post-merge-cleanup.sh`
processes the branch-derived issue plus every closing-keyword reference in the
PR title, body, and commit messages, and warns about bare `#N` title
references it did not process. Verify the transition for **each** referenced
item — do not stop after the first. A "references issue(s) … without a closing
keyword" warning is **non-terminal**: cleanup stays incomplete until every
named issue has an explicit disposition — processed (closed and
status-updated) or confirmed non-closing — recorded in the item report.

**Key rules:**

- When a spec or plan PR is merged, set the tracker status to the corresponding **Ready** status (`Spec Ready` or `Plan Ready`) — **not** `Merged`. Only implementation PRs (feature, fix, refactor, hotfix) go to `Merged`.
- The `/post-merge-cleanup` skill and `post-merge-cleanup` command follow this same table when updating tracker status.
- Prefer the canonical cleanup helper after merge verification. Pass the target
  base explicitly when it is not the repository default. In `workflow_hub` mode,
  pass `--repo <product-repo>` for product-owned implementation branches:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash-zsh -->
```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh [--repo <product-repo>] --base <base-branch> --pr <merged-pr-number> <merged-branch>
```

- After cleanup, re-read the live tracker status and Project status. If the live
  status does not match the expected value in the table above, re-apply the
  tracker transition before reporting the item terminal.
- For implementation branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, and
  `hotfix/*`), `post-merge-cleanup.sh` must report remote branch cleanup
  evidence before the item is terminal. Accept `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=deleted`
  or `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=not_found` as successful/idempotent outcomes after a
  merged PR is verified. Treat `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=skipped` or
  `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=failed` as non-terminal cleanup failures and report the
  named branch and PR context. Spec and implementation-plan branches are
  expected-persistent remotely and do not require implementation remote deletion
  evidence.
- Before reporting post-merge cleanup or tracker reconciliation complete, run
  `item-completion-self-check.sh` for the cleanup claim, using the current base
  branch (the merged workflow branch should already be deleted), the current
  base worktree path, `--stage cleanup`, and
  `--expected-tracker-status "<expected status>"`. Paste the
  `## Ground-Truth Completion Verification` section into the cleanup report.
  Any `discrepancy` or `unavailable_required` result keeps cleanup non-terminal.
- If manual cleanup is required, clean up local branches and worktrees associated with the merged PR:

```bash
git fetch origin
cd <repo-root>                          # CRITICAL: change to repo root before removing worktree (see Step 3)
git worktree remove <worktree-path>     # remove worktree first (branch is checked out there)
git branch -D <merged-branch>           # force-delete local branch (squash merges need -D)
```

If the item's tracker status is already in a further-advanced state (e.g., already `In Development` when a spec PR merges), do not roll it back — leave it as-is and only clean up local branches/worktrees.

## Step 11: Guardrails Audit Recording

After any delegated review decision, fix, merge, block, or escalation decision,
record audit evidence if `audit.pr_disposition_record` is `required` in the
effective guardrails. See `guardrails-enforcement.md` section 8 for the full
rules and helper invocations.

**Named stop-and-name behavior**: At any decision point during the run, if a
configured stop condition is met or required state is missing, stop before the
guarded action and report:

1. The exact stop condition name (from `guardrails-enforcement.md` section 4).
2. The affected work item (issue number, PR number, or branch).
3. The human action required to unblock.

Stop conditions never weaken below the baseline human-stops defined in
`guardrails-enforcement.md` section 4. Every stop appears in the Work Item
Runner Summary under a "Stops" section with its named cause, affected item, and
unblocking action.
