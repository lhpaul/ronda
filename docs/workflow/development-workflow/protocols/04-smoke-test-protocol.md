# Protocol: Smoke Test

**Agent role**: Smoke Tester
**Stage**: In Development (step after code review is approved)
**Output**: Pass/fail report per runbook step

---

## Project-specific details

This protocol is project-agnostic. **Project-specific instructions** — environment setup, execution approach (e.g. committed test suite vs ad-hoc script), known limitations, troubleshooting, and cleanup commands — live in the project's testing README.

- **In this repo**: See `docs/testing/README.md`.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the smoke test, the following must be true. If the human asks you to set up the environment yourself, follow the project testing README for exact commands.

- Any required backing services (e.g. Docker, local database) are running
- The database is in the expected state (e.g. reset and seeded)
- The target application is running locally and responding to HTTP requests
- The smoke test runbook path is provided by the human (or found via the project testing README)

If a migration or seed step fails, **do not fix it** — report the failure to the human and stop.

---

## Inputs

The human (or the workflow) provides:

1. **Runbook path**: Path to the smoke test runbook.
2. **Application URL** (optional): Base URL of the app under test. See the project testing README for defaults.

Also resolve repository mode and artifact ownership before executing the
runbook. Report whether the runbook or implementation artifact is hub-owned or
product-repository-owned. Missing mode or explicit `single_repo` means the
current repository owns the smoke-test context. In `workflow_hub`, hub runbooks
stay hub-owned, while product implementation validation must identify the
selected product repository before executing product-owned checks.

## Steps

### 1. Read Context

Before writing any test code, read:

- The **smoke test runbook**
- The **project testing README** — for environment setup, execution approach, known limitations, and troubleshooting
- **Application source code** for the pages under test (e.g. component templates) to understand selectors, labels, routes, and UI library patterns
- **Design assets** when the runbook or work item references them — discover via
  [`design-assets.md`](../design-assets.md) (issue-body `## Design assets`,
  tracker attachments, linked files, `<dev-folder>/assets/`). Absence of assets
  is not a failure; do not invent a baseline.

### 2. Choose and Execute the Test Approach

Before writing any code, check whether a committed automated spec already exists for the feature under test. The project testing README (`docs/testing/README.md`) has the decision tree for this project — follow it.

**Path A — Committed spec exists**:

Run the project's automated test suite for the affected feature. See the project testing README for the exact command. Do not write a duplicate ad-hoc script. Report the suite output as the test result.

**Path B — No spec exists yet** (ad-hoc fallback):

Write a browser automation script following the approach described in the project testing README. The script should:

1. Log into the application
2. Execute each runbook step sequentially
3. Record PASS/FAIL for each step
4. Use database queries for verification when UI elements are inaccessible (see project testing README for connection details and workarounds)

### 3. Record Results

For each runbook step, record:

- **Step number and description**
- **Result**: PASS or FAIL
- **Details**: What was observed (for failures, include expected vs. actual)

### 3a. Design fidelity steps (when present)

When the runbook includes expected-vs-actual fidelity steps against design
assets:

1. Execute them as a lightweight human/agent visual comparison (not pixel diff).
2. Record PASS or FAIL like any other step.
3. On FAIL, include expected-vs-actual detail naming the reference asset and what
   differed in the UI under test.
4. Do **not** treat design-reviewer as the primary fidelity gate; optional design
   review remains separate from these AC-driven smoke steps.
5. If the runbook has no fidelity steps (no assets were discovered at plan time),
   skip this subsection — missing assets are not a smoke failure.

## Output Format

```
## Smoke Test Report: [feature-name]

### Environment
- Application: [URL]
- Runbook: [path]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Results

| # | Step | Result | Details |
|---|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | [step description] | PASS/FAIL | [observation] |
| 2 | [step description] | PASS/FAIL | [observation] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Summary
- Total steps: [N]
- Passed: [N]
- Failed: [N]

### Verdict
[ ] PASSED — all steps pass, ready for merge
[ ] FAILED — see failed steps above
```

---

## Pass Criteria

- **All** runbook steps must pass for the smoke test to be considered successful

---

## Fail Handling

When a step fails:

1. Record the failure with details (expected vs. actual)
2. Take a screenshot if possible for context
3. Continue executing remaining steps (do not stop at first failure)
4. **Do NOT apply fixes** — that is the developer's responsibility
5. Report the full results to the human

---

## Cleanup

**Always run cleanup when the smoke test finishes or is interrupted**, regardless of pass/fail outcome. See the **project testing README** for the exact cleanup commands.
