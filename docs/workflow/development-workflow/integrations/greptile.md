# Integration: Greptile (Automated PR Review)

This document describes how to use [Greptile](https://greptile.com) as one automated PR reviewer tool in the workflow.

Greptile is **optional**. The workflow functions without it. See [`integrations/pr-review-platform.md`](pr-review-platform.md) for the multi-platform loop and aggregation rules.

---

## What Greptile Adds

- Automated code review on every PR, triggered on open/update
- Catches spec deviations, best practice violations, and security vulnerabilities before human review
- Reduces human review cycles by closing the feedback loop faster

---

## Setup

### 1. Install the Greptile GitHub App

Go to [greptile.com](https://greptile.com) and install the GitHub App on your repository. Greptile will automatically review PRs when opened or updated.

### 2. Configure the Review Scope (Optional)

You can guide Greptile's reviews by creating a `.greptile.yml` file at the root of the repository:

```yaml
# .greptile.yml
review:
  # Files or patterns to always include in reviews
  include:
    - "src/**"
    - "packages/**"
  # Files or patterns to exclude
  exclude:
    - "**/*.generated.ts"
    - "docs/**"
  # Reference files that provide context for reviews
  context:
    - "docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md"
    - "docs/best-practices/*.md"
```

## Step 7 — Greptile-Specific Implementation

The **Work Item Runner's** Step 7 (Automated Reviewer Loop) requires platform-specific commands. Below are the Greptile adapter details used by the shared helper.

### Preferred helper

When possible, call the repository helper instead of re-implementing the loop inline:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh <pr_number> --branch <branch_name> --platform greptile
```

It encapsulates the trigger, polling, comment classification, and stable aggregate `RESULT=` output used by the **Work Item Runner** (and by the **Portfolio Orchestrator** when it supervises item-level runs).

### Bot identity

Greptile posts as `greptile-apps[bot]`. Use this login to filter its comments and reviews from human activity.

### Step 7.1 — Trigger a re-review

After each push, record the timestamp and capture the comment ID (needed for Step 7.2):

```bash
last_push_at=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

review_comment_id="$(gh api \"repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<pr_number>/comments\" --method POST --raw-field body=\"@greptile review\" --jq '.id')"
```

### Step 7.2 — Detect review completion

Greptile signals that it has **finished** reviewing by adding a 👍 reaction to the `@greptile review` comment. This is the reliable completion signal regardless of whether it found blocking PR feedback.

```bash
# Poll until Greptile reacts with 👍 on the trigger comment
thumbs_up=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{review_comment_id}/reactions \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.content == \"+1\" and .user.login == \"greptile-apps[bot]\")] | length")
```

| Result                                     | Action                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `thumbs_up > 0`                            | Review complete — proceed to Step 7.3 to check for inline comments |
| `thumbs_up == 0` and `elapsed < max_wait`  | Not finished yet — wait another `poll_interval` and poll again     |
| `thumbs_up == 0` and `elapsed >= max_wait` | Timeout — escalate to human                                        |

### Step 7.3 — Fetch inline comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"greptile-apps[bot]\" and .created_at > \"$last_push_at\") | {path, line, body}]"
```

Apply the blocking-vs-suggestion classification rules defined in Step 7 of `91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` under `Blocking vs. suggestion classification`.
