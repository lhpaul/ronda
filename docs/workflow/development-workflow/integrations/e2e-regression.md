# Integration: E2E / Regression Tests

This template includes a label-gated GitHub Actions workflow for e2e/regression testing:

- `.github/workflows/e2e-regression.yml`

The placeholder workflow listens for PRs targeting `develop`, `develop-*`, or
`main` when the `ready-for-regression` label is present, and it can also be
dispatched directly for a qualifying PR head by `pr-policy.yml` after the
reviewer-loop summary is clean or legitimately skipped for the live PR head. The
placeholder job is disabled by default. It installs dependencies and browsers only when the
repository variable
`ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER_REGRESSION` is set to `true`.

The file is intentionally generic so downstream repositories can replace it with
their own label-gated test suites.

If a downstream repository replaces or splits the regression workflow, keep a
`workflow_dispatch` entrypoint that accepts `pr_number`, `head_sha`, `head_ref`,
and `base_ref`, or set `PR_POLICY_REGRESSION_WORKFLOW` to the dispatchable
workflow filename. Set `PR_POLICY_REGRESSION_DISPATCH_ENABLED=false` only when
regression is intentionally manual and the repository does not want
`pr-policy.yml` to dispatch it.

---

## How It Fits Into the Workflow

The `ready-for-regression` label is applied by the orchestrator (Step 7b in
`91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`) after the automated reviewer loop (Step 7) is
clean, and before the CI loop (Step 8). The `pr-policy.yml` workflow mirrors
that ordering for same-repository implementation PRs by waiting for the
canonical reviewer-loop summary comment, requiring its result to be `clean` or
allowed `skipped`, binding that summary to the live PR head, dispatching this
regression workflow on the PR head ref, and applying the label only after
dispatch succeeds and the PR head still matches. It does not apply
`ready-for-regression` from PR open, reopen, or ready-for-review events alone.
On new pushes, it removes stale labels unless current-head clean reviewer-loop
evidence is present. The explicit dispatch matters because labels applied with
the default GitHub Actions token do not reliably create downstream workflow runs
from `labeled` events. The
prepare-release flow applies the same label on production release PRs per
`05-prepare-release-protocol.md` Step 7.4. This means:

1. Step 7a: Internal review gate passes
2. Step 7: External automated reviewers are clean
3. **Step 7b: `ready-for-regression` label is applied** (triggers configured
   real regression checks, or this placeholder when explicitly enabled)
4. Step 8: CI loop polls `statusCheckRollup` — the e2e job appears as a check

Regression tests are expensive in time and compute, so they only run after all reviewer gates confirm the code is clean.

The CI loop (`pr-ci-loop.sh`) naturally picks up the e2e check result as part of its green/red polling. No script changes are needed.

---

## Label Gate Pattern

The workflow supports both explicit dispatches from `pr-policy.yml` and PR-event
label checks. Its `if` condition accepts qualifying `workflow_dispatch`
invocations, then falls back to the PR label state for PR-triggered runs:

```yaml
if: >-
  (
    github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' &&
    (
      inputs.base_ref == 'develop' ||
      startsWith(inputs.base_ref, 'develop-') ||
      inputs.base_ref == 'main'
    )
  ) ||
  (github.event.action == 'labeled' && github.event.label.name == 'ready-for-regression') ||
  (github.event.action != 'labeled' && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'ready-for-regression'))
```

- First clause: runs when `pr-policy.yml` explicitly dispatches regression for
  the PR head before applying `ready-for-regression`, preserving the same base
  branch scope as the PR trigger
- Second clause: fires when the label is just applied by a human or by a token
  that creates downstream workflow events
- Third clause: fires on `synchronize` (new push) or `reopened` if the label is
  already present

This means e2e tests re-run automatically after fixer pushes — the label stays
on the PR, and `synchronize` triggers the third clause.

## Default Behavior

The template ships with a minimal Playwright project at `e2e/` that has one
always-passing baseline test. The placeholder workflow is inactive by default so
private downstream repositories do not install Playwright or browser
dependencies before regression is intentionally enabled.

To run the placeholder as a temporary validation check, create a repository
variable named `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER_REGRESSION` with value `true`. Remove
that variable or set it to any other value to return the placeholder to the
disabled default.

---

## What Downstream Repositories Should Customize

Replace the placeholder e2e project with project-specific tests:

1. Update `e2e/package.json` with your dependencies (Playwright, Cypress, etc.).
2. Configure `e2e/playwright.config.ts` (or equivalent) with your base URL, projects, web server, and auth setup.
3. Replace `e2e/tests/baseline.spec.ts` with real regression specs.
4. Update the workflow steps in `.github/workflows/e2e-regression.yml` if your test runner differs (e.g. different install commands, environment variables, artifact uploads).

You may also:

- Remove the `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER_REGRESSION` guard once the placeholder
  steps are replaced by a real suite that should always run after
  `ready-for-regression`.
- Keep the workflow dispatchable with the template's four inputs, or point
  `PR_POLICY_REGRESSION_WORKFLOW` at the dispatchable replacement workflow.
- Add the real e2e/regression check as a required status check in branch
  protection rules.
- Split into multiple workflow files for different test suites (each gated on `ready-for-regression`).
- Add environment variables or secrets for test infrastructure.

---

## Scope

The `ready-for-regression` label is applied to implementation PRs (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `refactor/*`) and to **production** release PRs (`release/*` → `main`) per [`05-prepare-release-protocol.md`](../protocols/05-prepare-release-protocol.md) Step 7.4, so configured real e2e/regression checks can run before merge. Spec and plan PRs (`spec/*`, `implementation-plan/*`) skip this label and regression testing.

---

## Notes

- The label persists on the PR after e2e tests pass. It is removed from
  implementation PRs when `pr-policy.yml` sees a new push without current-head
  clean reviewer-loop evidence.
- If `pr-policy.yml` cannot dispatch the regression workflow, it marks the
  condition in the policy logs and skips automatic `ready-for-regression`
  labeling. The reviewer-loop guard status is still evaluated independently.
- If the PR head changes after reviewer-loop clean, dispatch, or pre-label
  verification, `pr-policy.yml` skips automatic labeling so a newer head is not
  marked ready using older reviewer or regression evidence.
- `PR_POLICY_REGRESSION_DISPATCH_ENABLED=false` disables the explicit dispatch
  path for repositories that intentionally keep regression manual.
- This workflow does not store test credentials or environment URLs in the template.
- For projects without e2e tests, keep the placeholder disabled and do not
  configure it as a required check. The orchestrator will still apply the label,
  but the inactive placeholder will not spend runner minutes on browser setup.
- Use [`actions-cost-audit.md`](actions-cost-audit.md) when reviewing whether
  regression workflow run volume should stay as-is, be narrowed, or remain
  opt-in for downstream private repositories.
