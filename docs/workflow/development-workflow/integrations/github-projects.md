# Integration: GitHub Projects (Tracker Work Items)

This document describes how to connect the AI development workflow with [GitHub Projects (v2)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) as the tracker system for workflow work items.

GitHub Projects is **optional**. The workflow functions without it — the **Portfolio Orchestrator** simply requires human input to determine what to work on next.

---

## What GitHub Projects Adds

- The **Portfolio Orchestrator** can read work item status, priority, and iteration autonomously via `gh` CLI
- A custom **Status** field on the project board maps directly to workflow stages
- Custom fields (Priority, Due date, Type / Custom Type) drive automated
  prioritization
- Labels on issues map to work item types and scope
- Agents will read the **current brief** following tracker-agnostic rules in [`issue-tracker.md`](issue-tracker.md)

---

## Concepts

GitHub Projects v2 sits on top of GitHub Issues:

- **Issues** are the work items (title, body, comments, labels, assignees)
- **Project** is the workflow layer (custom fields like Status, Priority, Due date, views)
- Each issue added to the project gets project-specific field values (e.g., Status = "Spec Ready")
- The `gh` CLI and GraphQL API are used to read and update both issues and project fields

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Create the Project

Create a GitHub Project (v2) linked to your repository:

```bash
# Create a project owned by the repo owner (user or org)
gh project create --owner <OWNER> --title "<Project Name>"
```

Note the **project number** returned — you will use it in all `gh project` commands.

### 2. Configure the Status Field

GitHub Projects v2 creates a default **Status** single-select field. Configure it with the following options to match workflow stages:

| Status Option         | Workflow Stage                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Backlog               | Backlog                                                      |
| Writing Spec          | Spec is being drafted                                        |
| Spec in Review        | Spec PR is ready for human review / merge                    |
| Spec Ready            | Spec approved and merged. Implementation plan pending        |
| Writing Plan          | Implementation plan is being drafted                         |
| Plan in Review        | Plan PR is ready for human review / merge                    |
| Plan Ready            | Implementation plan approved and merged. Development pending |
| In Development        | Development in progress                                      |
| Development in Review | Development PR is ready for human review / merge             |
| Merged                | Development PR merged to `develop`                           |
| Released              | Released to production                                       |

To add or rename status options, use the project settings UI at `https://github.com/users/<OWNER>/projects/<NUMBER>/settings` (or the equivalent org URL).

### 2.1 Configure Built-In Project Workflows

GitHub Projects can run its own built-in workflow when an item is closed. Configure
that workflow so it does not override the AI development workflow's merge state:

- Preferred: set the built-in "item closed" workflow to update Status to `Merged`.
- Also acceptable: disable the built-in "item closed" Status update entirely.
- Do not configure the built-in workflow to set Status to `Released` when an item
  is closed.

Implementation PR merges follow this sequence:

1. The workflow closes the GitHub issue for the merged implementation branch.
2. `update-tracker-on-merge.yml` or `post-merge-cleanup.sh` sets the issue's
   project Status to `Merged` after the close action, so this repo-owned update
   is the last write in the normal merge path.
3. A later release workflow moves shipped issues from `Merged` to `Released`.

If the built-in "item closed" workflow sets Status to `Released`, it races with
and overrides the intended `Merged` status immediately after every implementation
merge. The repository merge-cleanup paths now compensate by reasserting `Merged`
after closing implementation issues, but the Project workflow should still be
configured correctly so UI-driven closes and downstream projects do not drift.

### 3. Add Custom Fields

Add these custom fields to the project (via project settings UI or GraphQL):

| Field    | Type                                                         | Purpose                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Priority | Single select: `Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`             | Drives orchestrator prioritization                                                      |
| Size     | Single select: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`                    | Drives work sizing and sprint planning                                                  |
| Due date | Date                                                         | Items due within 2 weeks get priority boost                                             |
| Type     | Single select: `Feature`, `Bug`, `Refactor`, `Workflow`      | Source of truth for work-item classification and workflow path routing                  |

The classification field is the source of truth for GitHub Projects
integrations. By default the workflow looks for `Custom Type`, `CustomType`,
then `Type`. If your board uses a different name, set
`issue_tracker.custom_fields.type_field` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`.

- `Feature` routes through the full pipeline: spec, plan, implementation.
- `Bug` routes through the fast-track fix path when the scope check allows it.
- `Refactor` routes through the plan-only refactor path.
- `Workflow` marks AI-development-framework/tooling work. In downstream product
  repositories, reserve `Feature` and `Bug` for product work and use `Workflow`
  for framework/process/tooling items. In this template repository, workflow
  framework work also uses `Workflow`.

### 4. Issue Labels (on the Repository)

Labels live on the repository, not the project. Keep labels for operational
automation and optional scope markers:

```bash
gh label create "scope:api" --description "API / backend"
gh label create "scope:frontend" --description "Frontend / UI"
# Add more as needed for your project's components
```

Operational labels such as `ready-for-human-review`, `needs-fixes`,
`ready-for-regression`, `reviewer-failed`, `feedback-staging`, and
`integration-branch:<slug>` remain labels because workflow automation consumes
them directly.

Do **not** use repository labels as classification source of truth when
GitHub Projects is configured. Labels such as `bug`, `enhancement`,
`type:feature`, `type:bug`, `type:refactor`, and `workflow` are legacy
classification labels; new workflow automation should set/read the project
**Type** field instead.

Migration checklist:

1. Add the `Workflow` option to the project **Type** field.
2. Backfill Type values for open items from current labels and issue context.
3. Verify open workflow/framework items have `Type = Workflow`.
4. Remove retired classification labels from open issues after Type is set.

## Status: Tracker as Source of Truth

Workflow status (Spec Ready, Plan Ready, In Development) is **not** stored in the spec document. The project item's Status field is the source of truth. The helper script `workflow-next-action.sh --development <path>` derives the next action from **repo state** (presence of implementation plan file, feature branch) so it works without reading a status field from the spec. See `scripts/development-workflow/README.md` and `workflow-next-action.sh` for the logic. Orchestrators and agents with `gh` CLI access should read and update work item status in the project at stage transitions.

When `gh` is available, the script detects merged PRs via `gh pr list --state merged` and returns `NEXT_ACTION=skip` for items whose branch has already been merged — so calling it on Merged or Released items is safe in that configuration. Without `gh` CLI access, the script cannot distinguish a not-yet-created branch from a deleted one; in that case, prefer filtering work items by tracker status (e.g. exclude Merged/Released) before invoking the script.

---

## CLI Update Patterns for Agents and Subagents

GitHub Projects status updates can be performed entirely via `gh` CLI and Bash — no MCP server is required. This means subagent Work Item Runners dispatched from parallel batch runs can update tracker status directly at Step 8b without deferring to the orchestrator.

For workflow-hub product releases, tracker reconciliation evidence is
hub-owned. Product repositories may own product branch, PR, deployment, tag, and
GitHub Release evidence, but the project Status transition and durable tracker
reconciliation note stay with the hub tracker item.

### Board membership check (ensure_on_project_board)

Before updating tracker status, each stage agent (spec-writer, plan-writer, developer) must ensure the issue is registered on the project board. The `ensure_on_project_board` function in `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh` handles this idempotently:

```bash
# Source workflow-lib.sh to get ensure_on_project_board
# shellcheck source=scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh
source scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh

# Call before tracker status update in the agent completion sequence.
# initial_status: "Writing Spec" (spec agent), "Writing Plan" (plan agent), "In Development" (developer agent)
ensure_on_project_board "$ISSUE_NUMBER" "$INITIAL_STATUS"
```

The function is **fail-open**: if the issue is already on the board it returns 0 immediately without modifying the existing status; if the board-add API call fails for any reason (rate limit, permissions error) it logs a warning and returns 0 so the agent can continue to open the PR. The initial status is only applied when the issue is newly added to the board — the subsequent `update_tracker_status_best_effort` call handles the normal stage-progression update independently.

### One-shot status update (recommended pattern)

Use the shared helper when a stage completes and the tracker status must advance. It performs a targeted `repository.issue(...).projectItems` lookup for the single issue and avoids `gh project item-list`, which paginates the whole board and can drain the GraphQL rate-limit bucket.

```bash
# Source workflow-lib.sh to get the targeted GitHub Projects helpers.
# shellcheck source=scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh
source scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh

ISSUE_NUMBER=<ISSUE>                         # GitHub issue number to update
TARGET_STATUS="Development in Review"        # Use a value from the table below

update_tracker_status_best_effort "$ISSUE_NUMBER" "$TARGET_STATUS"
```

For manual debugging, call `workflow_github_project_item_for_issue <issue> <project-number>` after sourcing `workflow-lib.sh`; it returns the project item ID, project ID, current Status, and current Type for exactly one issue.

### One-shot Type update and discovery

Use the shared Type helpers when GitHub Projects is the configured tracker:

```bash
# shellcheck source=scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh
source scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh

get_tracker_type_for_issue "$ISSUE_NUMBER"
update_tracker_type_best_effort "$ISSUE_NUMBER" "Workflow"
list_open_workflow_type_issues
```

`get_tracker_type_for_issue` and `update_tracker_type_best_effort` use the same
targeted `repository.issue(...).projectItems` lookup as the Status helpers.
The targeted Type read honors `issue_tracker.custom_fields.type_field`, then
GitHub's native Issue Type, then `Custom Type`, `CustomType`, and `Type`.
Type writes remain limited to configured project fields; this does not add
native Issue Type mutation support.
`list_open_workflow_type_issues` fetches open issues first and then
cross-references a single project item-list result, so callers do not perform
one full-board scan per issue.

### Status values by workflow stage (Step 8b targets)

| PR type                                                                  | Target status string    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `spec/*` PR ready for human review                                       | `Spec in Review`        |
| `implementation-plan/*` PR ready for human review                        | `Plan in Review`        |
| `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*` PR ready for human review | `Development in Review` |

### Caching field and option IDs

Field IDs and option IDs are stable within a project.
`update_tracker_status_best_effort` and `update_tracker_type_best_effort` cache
field metadata in memory for the current shell process after the first targeted
lookup, so repeated updates in the same run do not need repeated field metadata
queries. The Type cache is scoped by the configured classification field name.
Re-run the helper in a fresh shell if the project field configuration changes.

## Orchestrator Instructions (with GitHub Projects)

When the **Portfolio Orchestrator** has `gh` CLI access, it should:

1. Query project items by status to find items eligible for advancement
2. Check for linked issues or task lists for dependencies
3. Sort eligible items: due within 2 weeks -> priority -> creation date
4. Update the project item's Status field as stages complete

### Reading Project Items

**Performance note**: `gh project item-list` paginates all board items, including closed and merged
ones. On boards with 300+ items this exhausts the 5 000-point GraphQL rate limit, causing a
~3.5-minute pause that grows as more items accumulate. Prefer the open-issue approach below.

**Recommended: query open issues first, then cross-reference with a single item-list call**

GitHub Projects v2 has no server-side open-issue filter on the items node, so a full `item-list`
fetch is unavoidable. The key optimisation is to fetch open issues from the GitHub Issues API
(which supports state filtering) and then cross-reference them against the project board items
client-side — this ensures downstream processing only touches open candidates:

```bash
# Step 1: list open issues only (the only candidates for orchestrator advancement)
OPEN_ISSUES=$(gh issue list --state open --limit 1000 --json number,title,labels,createdAt)

# Step 2: fetch all project board items once and filter to only open-issue candidates
gh project item-list <PROJECT_NUMBER> --owner <OWNER> --limit 10000 --format json \
  | jq --argjson open "$OPEN_ISSUES" \
    '[.items[] | . as $item | ($open[] | select(.number == $item.content.number)) // empty | {number: .number, title: .title, status: $item.status}]'
```

**Alternative: client-side terminal-status filter (simpler, same single item-list call)**

When you want a simpler filter without loading the open-issue list separately, fetch all items
and immediately discard terminal-status entries client-side:

```bash
# Fetch all items and filter out terminal statuses client-side
gh project item-list <PROJECT_NUMBER> --owner <OWNER> --limit 10000 --format json \
  | jq '[.items[] | select(.status != null and (.status | IN("Done","Merged","Released","Cancelled")) | not)]'
```

**Rate-limit check**: check remaining GraphQL quota before and after large pagination:

```bash
gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources.graphql | {limit, remaining, used, reset: (.reset | todate)}'
```

Warn the human when `remaining` falls below 1 000 points. Pause dispatch when below 200 points
and report the reset time. See Protocol 90 Step 1a for the full rate-limit guidance.

### Updating Status via GraphQL

Updating project item fields requires GraphQL. For agent and script use, prefer `update_tracker_status_best_effort` from `workflow-lib.sh`; it resolves the item ID through a targeted single-issue query and caches Status field metadata for the run.

If you must issue the GraphQL manually, do not use `gh project item-list` for a single issue. Resolve the item through the issue's projectItems connection:

```bash
gh api graphql \
  -f owner=<REPO_OWNER> \
  -f repo=<REPO_NAME> \
  -F issueNumber=<ISSUE_NUMBER> \
  -F projectNumber=<PROJECT_NUMBER> \
  -f query='
    query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $issueNumber: Int!, $projectNumber: Int!) {
      repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
        issue(number: $issueNumber) {
          projectItems(first: 50) {
            nodes {
              id
              project { id number }
              status: fieldValueByName(name: "Status") {
                ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue { name }
              }
              type: fieldValueByName(name: "Type") {
                ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue { name }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }' \
  | jq --argjson projectNumber <PROJECT_NUMBER> \
    '.data.repository.issue.projectItems.nodes[]
     | select(.project.number == $projectNumber)
     | {item_id: .id, project_id: .project.id, status: .status.name, type: .type.name}'
```

Then use the returned `project_id` with a Status field/option lookup and apply the mutation:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation {
    updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
      projectId: "<PROJECT_ID>"
      itemId: "<ITEM_ID>"
      fieldId: "<STATUS_FIELD_ID>"
      value: { singleSelectOptionId: "<OPTION_ID>" }
    }) {
      projectV2Item { id }
    }
  }'
```

### Closing Issues

When a work item reaches **Merged** status, close the corresponding GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue close <ISSUE_NUMBER>
```

### Release Milestones

For GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects providers, the release-stamp operation uses
GitHub Milestones as the native "shipped in version" marker.

Convention:

- Milestone titles match production tags, for example `v1.2.0`.
- `prepare-release-post-merge-cleanup.sh` creates a missing milestone when an
  explicit released issue set is supplied.
- The helper assigns the milestone to each shipped issue before or alongside the
  `Merged` -> `Released` project Status transition.
- After at least one issue is stamped, the helper closes the release milestone as
  part of post-merge cleanup.
- GitHub Projects can display the built-in Milestone field in board views, so no
  custom project field is required to group or filter shipped issues by release.

Release stamping is best effort. A milestone create or assignment failure is
reported in the cleanup summary as `STAMP_FAILED`, but it does not block the
existing tracker Status transition.

---

## Branch Naming with GitHub Issues

When a GitHub issue exists, use the issue number as the branch slug prefix:

| Branch type         | Pattern                                     | Example                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Spec                | `spec/<issue-number>-<slug>`                | `spec/42-user-auth`                |
| Implementation plan | `implementation-plan/<issue-number>-<slug>` | `implementation-plan/42-user-auth` |
| Feature             | `feature/<issue-number>-<slug>`             | `feature/42-user-auth`             |
| Refactor            | `refactor/<issue-number>-<slug>`            | `refactor/33-extract-auth-service` |
| Bug fix             | `fix/<issue-number>-<slug>`                 | `fix/56-login-redirect`            |
| Hotfix              | `hotfix/<issue-number>-<slug>`              | `hotfix/89-payment-crash`          |

The `<slug>` is a short kebab-case description derived from the issue title.

---

## Workflow: Advancing Statuses

The **Portfolio Orchestrator**, **Work Item Runner**, or stage agent updates the project item Status at each stage transition:

| Action                                                                                          | Status transition                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human or Portfolio Orchestrator selects the item; Work Item Runner dispatches `product-manager` | -> Writing Spec                                                  |
| Spec PR is human-ready (automation clean; ready for humans)                                     | -> Spec in Review                                                |
| Spec PR merged                                                                                  | -> Spec Ready                                                    |
| Human or Portfolio Orchestrator selects the item; Work Item Runner dispatches `tech-lead`       | -> Writing Plan (Refactor items skip directly here from Backlog) |
| Plan PR is human-ready (automation clean)                                                       | -> Plan in Review                                                |
| Plan PR merged                                                                                  | -> Plan Ready                                                    |
| Human or Portfolio Orchestrator selects the item; Work Item Runner dispatches `developer`       | -> In Development                                                |
| Feature/fix PR is human-ready (automation clean)                                                | -> Development in Review                                         |
| Feature/fix PR merged to develop                                                                | -> Merged                                                        |
| Release deployed to production                                                                  | -> Released                                                      |

## Automated Tracker Updates on PR Merge (GitHub Projects + GitHub Actions)

GitHub Projects-backed repositories may include a GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/update-tracker-on-merge.yml`) that automatically updates the
GitHub Projects status whenever a workflow PR is merged to `develop`. This
automation applies only when `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` declares
`issue_tracker.provider: github_projects` and the repository has configured the
project variables listed below.

For Linear-backed repositories, do not add this GitHub Projects workflow. Use
the Linear MCP/API closeout path described in [`linear.md`](linear.md) instead.
For GitHub Issues without Projects, PR merge cleanup can close issues, but there
is no Project Status field to update. This provider-specific scoping avoids the
stale-status problem that occurs between orchestrator runs in GitHub Projects
repositories without implying equivalent behavior for every tracker provider.

### Branch-to-status mapping

| Branch prefix           | Status after merge | Issue closed? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `spec/*`                | Spec Ready         | No            |
| `implementation-plan/*` | Plan Ready         | No            |
| `feature/*`             | Merged             | Yes           |
| `fix/*`                 | Merged             | Yes           |
| `refactor/*`            | Merged             | Yes           |
| `hotfix/*`              | Merged             | Yes           |
| `develop-<slug>`        | Graduation closeout fallback (same reconciler as Protocol 05b Step 5) | Via closeout helper |

Non-graduation mappings above are unchanged. Graduation heads no longer silently
skip: the workflow runs
`scripts/development-workflow/graduation-closeout-from-merged-pr.sh`, which
discovers slug/epic/deferral signals and invokes `graduation-closeout.sh`.

### How it works

1. Triggered on `pull_request` closed events targeting `develop` where `merged == true`
2. Extracts the branch prefix to determine the stage type
3. For non-graduation branches: extracts the issue number from the branch name (e.g., `fix/463-some-slug` → `463`)
4. Queries the GitHub Projects v2 GraphQL API to find the project item for that issue
5. Updates the `Status` field to the appropriate value
6. For implementation branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`): also closes the GitHub issue
7. For graduation heads (`develop-<slug>`): checks out the repo and runs the
   graduation closeout fallback instead of the per-issue status mapping

### Required configuration (GitHub Projects only)

Set the following as **repository variables** (not secrets — these are not sensitive):

| Variable                | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER` | The integer project number (e.g. `1`)                                                          |
| `GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER`  | The GitHub user or org owning the project (falls back to `github.repository_owner` when unset) |

To set them via CLI:

```bash
gh variable set GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER --body "1"
gh variable set GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER --body "<your-github-username-or-org>"
```

### Security model

- Uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no personal access token (PAT) required
- Minimum permissions: `pull-requests: read`, `issues: write`, `projects: write`
- All external action SHAs are pinned to exact commit hashes (no floating `@v7` tags)

### Relationship to `post-merge-cleanup` (GitHub Projects only)

The GitHub Actions workflow and the `post-merge-cleanup` CLI command perform the same tracker
update logic. They are complementary:

- **GitHub Actions workflow**: runs automatically on every PR merge, no human action needed
- **`post-merge-cleanup` command**: run manually by a developer or orchestrator after merging;
  also handles local branch deletion and `develop` pull

If both are active, the tracker update from `post-merge-cleanup` is idempotent (same status
written twice is harmless). For implementation branches, cleanup also reasserts `Merged` after
closing the issue so a built-in "item closed" Project workflow cannot leave the item at
`Released`.

## Post-Merge Cleanup

When a PR is merged, the `post-merge-cleanup` command will:

1. Extract the issue number from the branch name (e.g., `feature/42-user-auth` -> `42`)
2. Apply the action appropriate for the branch type:
   - `spec/*`: issue stays open; update project item Status to **Spec Ready**
   - `implementation-plan/*`: issue stays open; update project item Status to **Plan Ready**
   - `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`: close the GitHub issue (`gh issue close 42`) and update project item Status to **Merged** after close
3. Each tracker update is best-effort: if `GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER` is unset or the API call fails, a warning is logged and the script continues without aborting

---

## Release Post-Merge Cleanup

After a release branch has merged to both `main` and `develop`, use:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/prepare-release-post-merge-cleanup.sh vX.Y.Z --issues 101,102
```

This script:

1. Verifies both release PRs are merged before any branch deletion
2. Deletes `release/vX.Y.Z` on `origin` and locally (when safe)
3. Transitions explicit scoped issues from merged-to-integration to released-to-production

Status label defaults and overrides:

- `GITHUB_PROJECT_STATUS_MERGED` (default: `Merged`)
- `GITHUB_PROJECT_STATUS_RELEASED` (default: `Released`)

Use explicit issue numbers to avoid accidental broad transitions. Items not included in the shipped release should remain unchanged.

---

## Graduation Closeout Status

After an integration branch graduation PR merges from `develop-<slug>` to
`develop`, Protocol 05b Step 5 remains the **primary** closeout path:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/graduation-closeout.sh \
  --slug <slug> \
  --graduation-pr <graduation-pr-number> \
  --epic <epic-issue-number>
```

Merge-time automation is a **fallback**: `update-tracker-on-merge.yml` invokes
`graduation-closeout-from-merged-pr.sh` for merged graduation heads, which
discovers the slug/epic and calls the same reconciler. Operator controls:

- CLI `--defer-epic-close` / `--exclude-issue` on Step 5
- Durable epic label `defer-epic-close` (applied automatically when Step 5 uses
  `--defer-epic-close`; also honored when present before automation runs)
- Sub-item skip labels already honored by the reconciler (`optional`,
  `deferred`, `cancelled`, `excluded-from-graduation`,
  `exclude-from-graduation`)

The helper validates that the graduation PR already merged from
`develop-<slug>` to `develop`, then reconciles delivered planned sub-items
before closing the parent epic. It discovers planned work from native GitHub
sub-issues, the legacy `integration-branch:<slug>` label fallback, and closing
keywords in merged PRs that targeted `develop-<slug>`. If discovery is
incomplete or no delivered sub-items can be identified, closeout fails and holds
the parent epic open.

For each delivered sub-item, it closes the GitHub issue when needed and then
reasserts the terminal Project status so built-in GitHub Projects close
automation cannot leave stale tracker state behind. Closed but non-terminal
items receive only the Project status update. Already terminal items are
reported without moving them backward. Optional, deferred, cancelled, or
explicitly excluded sub-items remain open and are listed for human disposition.

Terminal status is resolved in this order:

- `GITHUB_PROJECT_STATUS_GRADUATED`
- `GITHUB_PROJECT_STATUS_MERGED`
- `Merged`

Use `GITHUB_PROJECT_STATUS_GRADUATED=Done` or
`GITHUB_PROJECT_STATUS_GRADUATED=Released` in repositories whose Project board
uses those labels for completed graduation work. The configured option must
exist in the Project `Status` field. If closeout prints
`GRADUATION_CLOSEOUT_RESULT=failed`, repair the listed `failed` items or
discovery problem and rerun the helper before treating the graduation as
complete.

## Prerequisites

- **`gh` CLI** authenticated with a token that has `project` and `repo` scopes:
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  # Verify access:
  gh project list --owner <OWNER>
  ```
- **Project number** — find it via `gh project list --owner <OWNER>` or from the project URL

---

## Custom Fields

The `issue_tracker.custom_fields` flat map in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` is
available for provider-specific configuration extensions. For the
`github_projects` provider, workflow scripts currently recognize:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `type_field` | Overrides the GitHub Projects classification field name used by Type helpers, for example `Custom Type`. |

Key points:

- The `project_number` field is a standard top-level `issue_tracker` field — it is not a custom field and must remain under `issue_tracker` directly, not under `custom_fields`.
- Unrecognized keys placed under `custom_fields` are silently ignored by current GitHub Projects scripts.
- Future provider-specific fields (e.g., additional project metadata) may be added here as the integration evolves.

Read the `workflow_issue_tracker_custom_field` helper documentation in `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh` for the parsing API available to future consumers.

## Without GitHub Projects

If you don't use GitHub Projects, the **Portfolio Orchestrator** asks the human:

> "What should I work on next? Please provide:
>
> - Feature name and slug
> - Path: Full Pipeline / Refactor / Fast Track / Hotfix
> - Priority context (if any)
> - Dependencies (if any)"

This works fine for small teams or early-stage projects.
