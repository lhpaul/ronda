# Integration: Issue Tracker (Generic)

This document defines **tracker-agnostic** expectations for how agents should use a work-item tracker (Linear, GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.) as an input source.

> Tracker-specific setup (APIs/MCP) lives in `docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/`.
> If this repository uses a tracker, declare it in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` under `issue_tracker.provider`.

## What Agents Must Read (when available)

Before starting work on an item, agents must treat the tracker work item as the **source of the current brief** and read:

- **Title**
- **Description/body**
- **Most recent comments** (at minimum: the last 5, or any comments since the last agent run)
- **Linked work items / dependencies** (if the tracker supports it)
- **Priority + due date + status** (for orchestration/prioritization)

If the agent does not have direct tracker access, it must ask the human to paste:

- the current description, and
- the relevant recent comments (especially any decisions/changes).

---

## How to Interpret Comments

- **Prefer recency**: newer comments override older ones if they conflict.
- **Prefer explicit decisions**: “Decision: …”, “We will …”, “Out of scope: …” are high-signal.
- **Preserve confirmed design decisions for spec dispatch**: comments with
  explicit human correction, approval, clarification, or decision language can
  feed `spec-dispatch-context.sh` so spec writers receive confirmed product
  constraints before drafting begins.
- **Don’t guess**: if comments introduce ambiguity or contradict the spec/plan, **stop and ask** for clarification.
- **Don’t silently discard** tracker context: if it changes scope/requirements, call it out explicitly in the stage output (spec/plan/PR).

---

## Stage-Specific Rules

- **Writing Spec**: treat the work item as “in flight” until the spec PR is human-ready; keep the brief and any new comments in sync with the spec branch/PR.
- **Writing Plan (Full Pipeline)**: same as **Writing Spec**, but for the implementation-plan branch/PR after the spec is merged.
- **Writing Plan (Refactor)**: treat the work item as “in flight” until the plan PR is human-ready; keep the brief and any new comments in sync with the plan branch/PR. There is no spec — the work item brief is the starting input.
- **Development in Review**: treat the work item as waiting on a human merge decision for the feature/fix PR; address `needs-fixes` promptly if the human requests changes.
- **Spec Ready**: use the work item description/comments as the starting point for the alignment checklist; any decision captured in comments must be reflected in the spec (or surfaced as an Open Question if still unresolved).
- **Plan Ready (Full Pipeline)**: if comments contain new constraints after the spec was merged, flag the discrepancy and request a spec update before proceeding.
- **Plan Ready (Refactor)**: if comments contain new constraints after the plan was written, flag the discrepancy and request a plan update before proceeding. There is no spec — the plan and work item brief are the authoritative sources.
- **In Development (Full Pipeline)**: scan recent comments for post-plan scope changes. If anything conflicts with the spec or plan, stop and request an update before coding.
- **In Development (Refactor)**: scan recent comments for post-plan scope changes. If anything conflicts with the plan, stop and request an update before coding. There is no spec for refactor items — the plan and work item brief are the authoritative sources.
- **In Development (Fast Track)**: the work item description/comments can be the brief; confirm the Protocol 91 Fast Track blast-radius gate passed and stop if scope expands, high call-site volume appears, or external-system impact is discovered after dispatch.

## Deferred-action protocol

For non-CLI providers (e.g., Linear) where helper scripts cannot reach the
tracker API directly, scripts emit a structured deferred-action line to stdout
instead of attempting the mutation:

```
TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=<action_type> issue=<issue_id>[ <extra_fields>]
```

Orchestrators must scan every Work Item Runner's output for these lines and
apply the corresponding mutations via MCP or API before moving to the next item.
A deferred action that is not applied must be recorded explicitly so that
observers can see the tracker is out of sync rather than assuming advancement
occurred.

Field values that contain spaces are single-quoted in the output (e.g.,
`target_status='Plan in Review'`, `title='My New Feature'`). Strip the
surrounding single quotes when reading the value. Single-word values are
emitted without quotes.

See [`linear.md`](linear.md) for the full reference table of action types
(`set_status`, `read_status`, `create_item`) and the three-phase bridge pattern
that defines how orchestrators pre-resolve Linear data and collect deferred
actions.

## Release Stamping

Release cleanup records which production version shipped each explicit issue via
a provider-routed operation:

```bash
record_release_for_issue_best_effort <issue> <version>
```

The finalized `CHANGELOG.md` release section is the provider-independent source
for which issues shipped. Cleanup helpers keep the issue list explicit with
`--issue` or `--issues` so a release cannot accidentally stamp every item in a
tracker status.

| Provider | Release marker |
| --- | --- |
| `github_projects`, `github_issues` | GitHub Milestone named like `v1.2.0` |
| `jira` | Fix Version/s, when a Jira integration implements the write path |
| `linear` | Default label `release/v1.2.0`, or a configured custom field |
| `clickup`, `notion` | Configured custom field, tag, or select property |
| `none` | No-op |

Release stamping is best effort. Unsupported or unavailable providers must log a
clear warning/skip and continue with the rest of release cleanup. A stamp failure
must not block the `Merged` -> `Released` status transition.
