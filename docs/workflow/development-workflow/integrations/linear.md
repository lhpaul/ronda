# Integration: Linear (Tracker Work Items)

This document describes how to connect the AI development workflow with [Linear](https://linear.app) as the tracker system for workflow work items.

Linear is **optional**. The workflow functions without it — the **Portfolio Orchestrator** simply requires human input to determine what to work on next.

---

## What Linear Adds

- The **Portfolio Orchestrator** can read work item status, priority, and due dates autonomously
- Status fields in Linear map directly to workflow stages
- Labels in Linear map to work item types and scope
- Priority and due date drive automated prioritization
- Agents will read the **current brief** following tracker-agnostic rules in [`issue-tracker.md`](issue-tracker.md)

---

## Work Item Setup

### Status Field → Workflow Stage Mapping

Configure the following statuses in your Linear team settings:

| Linear Status         | Workflow Stage                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backlog               | Backlog                                                                                            |
| Writing Spec          | Spec is being drafted and driven to human-ready (draft PR, internal review, reviewer tools, CI)    |
| Spec in Review        | Spec PR is ready for human review / merge                                                          |
| Spec Ready            | Spec PR is merged                                                                                  |
| Writing Plan          | Implementation plan is being drafted and driven to human-ready (same PR-readiness pattern as spec) |
| Plan in Review        | Plan PR is ready for human review / merge                                                          |
| Plan Ready            | Plan PR is merged                                                                                  |
| In Development        | Feature/fix PR in progress (draft through PR readiness, until human-ready)                         |
| Development in Review | Feature/fix PR is ready for human review / merge                                                   |
| Merged                | Feature/fix PR merged to `develop`                                                                 |
| Released              | Released to production                                                                             |

### Labels

**Type labels** (one per work item):

- `Feature` — new capability
- `Bug` — something broken
- `Refactor` — code restructuring or tech-debt cleanup

**Scope labels** (one or more per work item):

- Add labels matching your app/service names (e.g., `Admin Portal`, `API`, `Mobile`)

### Priority

Use Linear's built-in priority field:

- Urgent (1) → Urgent
- High (2) → High
- Medium (3) → Normal
- Low (4) → Low

### Due Date

Set due dates on work items that have a deadline. The **Portfolio Orchestrator** treats work items due within 2 weeks as higher priority than the abstract priority field.

---

## Status: Tracker as Source of Truth

Workflow status (Spec Ready, Plan Ready, In Development) is **not** stored in the spec document. The tracker work item in Linear is the source of truth. The helper script `workflow-next-action.sh --development <path>` derives the next action from **repo state** (presence of implementation plan file, feature branch) so it works without reading a status field from the spec. See `scripts/development-workflow/README.md` and `workflow-next-action.sh` for the logic. Orchestrators and agents with Linear access should read and update work item status in Linear at stage transitions. **Do not call this script for work items in Merged or Released status;** the script cannot distinguish a not-yet-created branch from a deleted one.

---

## Orchestrator Instructions (with Linear)

When the **Portfolio Orchestrator** has Linear access, it should:

1. Read `issue_tracker.custom_fields.project` from `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` and, if present, scope all item-discovery queries to that project. If absent, emit a warning and fall back to the unscoped team query (see Protocol 90 Step 1a).
2. Query work items by status to find items eligible for advancement
3. Check the `Depends on` field (or linked work item relationships) for dependencies
4. Sort eligible items: due within 2 weeks → priority → creation date
5. Update work item status as stages complete (e.g., set to "In Development" when the feature branch is created)

---

## Bridge Pattern

The shell helper scripts (`workflow-lib.sh`, `workflow-batch-plan.sh`,
`add-backlog-item.sh`, `run-epic-scope-resolver.sh`) cannot reach the Linear API
directly. Instead, they implement a **bridge pattern** so that the orchestrator —
the only actor with Linear access — handles all reads and writes.

### Three-phase flow

1. **Pre-resolve** — Before dispatching any Work Item Runner, the orchestrator
   queries the configured Linear team via MCP to fetch open items with their
   status, type, priority, and dependencies. The orchestrator holds this resolved
   data set and makes it available to each batch step.

2. **Emit deferred action** — When a helper script needs a Linear mutation
   (status change, item creation) or needs to signal that a status read was
   deferred, it prints a structured `TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=` line to stdout
   instead of attempting the operation itself.

3. **Orchestrator applies** — After each Work Item Runner step completes, the
   orchestrator scans the output for `TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=` and
   `TRACKER_UPDATE_REQUIRED:` lines and applies the corresponding Linear
   mutations via MCP.

### `TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=` output format reference

Every deferred-action line follows this structure:

```
TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=<action_type> issue=<issue_id>[ <extra_fields>]
```

| Action type   | Emitted by                           | Extra fields example                     | Description                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `set_status`  | `update_tracker_status_best_effort`  | `target_status='Plan in Review'`         | Linear item status should be moved to `<status>` via MCP. |
| `read_status` | `get_tracker_status_for_issue`       | _(none)_                                 | Status read was deferred; orchestrator supplies the value. |
| `create_item` | `add-backlog-item.sh create`         | `title='My New Feature'`                 | New Linear item should be created via MCP.                |

**Quoting convention**: when a field value contains spaces, it is
single-quoted in the output — for example, `target_status='Plan in Review'`
rather than `target_status=Plan in Review`. Single-word values are not
quoted. Strip the surrounding single quotes when reading the value.
Linear status names do not contain single quotes, making this quoting safe
for all controlled-vocabulary values in the workflow.

**Orchestrator collection loop** (pseudocode):

```
for each Work Item Runner output line:
  if line starts with "TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=":
    parse action_type from "TRACKER_ACTION_REQUIRED=<action_type> ..."
    parse issue from "... issue=<id> ..."
    parse extra_field value (strip single quotes if present)
    apply via Linear MCP (e.g., updateIssue, createIssue)
  if line starts with "TRACKER_UPDATE_REQUIRED:":
    parse issue number and target_status
    apply via Linear MCP updateIssue
```

The `TRACKER_UPDATE_REQUIRED:` format (used in protocol 91 Step 8b) is a
complementary signal emitted by the agent-level summary when a tracker update
could not be performed inline. Both formats must be collected and applied.

### Priority Drift Detection

The Linear API can return a stale or drifted priority value when an item is
read back shortly after a write (e.g., a status update applied during
post-merge cleanup). The priority returned in the API response may reflect
a transient race condition between the write and the Linear webhook rather
than an intentional change.

**Detection rule**: After every `updateIssue` MCP call, read back the issue's
current priority from the API response (or issue a follow-up `issue(id:)` query
if the mutation response does not include the priority field). Compare the
returned value against the priority recorded at pre-resolve time (Phase 1).
If the values differ, emit the following warning to the run summary before
continuing:

```
PRIORITY_DRIFT_WARNING: issue=<id> dispatch_priority=<value> current_priority=<value>
  — priority changed between dispatch and post-update read.
  Possible causes: concurrent edit, transient API artifact, or webhook race.
  No workflow action taken. Human should verify the priority in Linear.
```

Do **not** silently accept the drifted value. Do **not** automatically restore
the original priority — a concurrent human edit is a valid reason for the
change. The warning surfaces the discrepancy for human review.

**Post-write re-read (optional but recommended)**: After applying any
`set_status` mutation, issue a follow-up `issue(id:)` query to confirm the
write was reflected. If the returned status does not match the target status,
emit:

```
TRACKER_WRITE_UNCONFIRMED: issue=<id> target_status=<expected> actual_status=<returned>
  — status not reflected in API read-back after write.
  May be a transient API artifact. Retry the update once; escalate if the
  mismatch persists after retry.
```

Retry the `updateIssue` call once if `TRACKER_WRITE_UNCONFIRMED` fires. If the
re-read still does not reflect the target status after one retry, log
`TRACKER_SYNC_SKIPPED` (using the existing format) with `reason=write_unconfirmed_after_retry`
and continue — do not block the workflow.

## Branch Naming with Linear

When a Linear work item exists, use the Linear identifier as the branch slug prefix:

| Branch type         | Pattern                                     | Example                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Spec                | `spec/[work-item-id]-[slug]`                | `spec/ENG-123-user-auth`                |
| Implementation plan | `implementation-plan/[work-item-id]-[slug]` | `implementation-plan/ENG-123-user-auth` |
| Feature             | `feature/[work-item-id]-[slug]`             | `feature/ENG-123-user-auth`             |
| Refactor            | `refactor/[work-item-id]-[slug]`            | `refactor/ENG-321-extract-auth-service` |
| Bug fix             | `fix/[work-item-id]-[slug]`                 | `fix/ENG-456-login-redirect`            |
| Hotfix              | `hotfix/[work-item-id]-[slug]`              | `hotfix/ENG-789-payment-crash`          |

The `[slug]` is a short kebab-case description derived from the work item title (omit common words like "add", "fix", "update" to keep it short). Linear also auto-suggests a branch name on each work item — use it directly if preferred.

---

## Custom Fields

The `issue_tracker.custom_fields` flat map in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` holds provider-specific fields that extend the standard `issue_tracker` configuration. For the Linear provider, the following keys are recognised by workflow scripts:

| Key                    | Format                   | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project`              | Linear project ID string | When set, (1) scopes Portfolio Orchestrator item discovery to this project only — items from other projects are excluded from the candidate list; and (2) associates new issues with this project on creation. The project ID is found in the Linear project URL (`https://linear.app/<team>/projects/<project-id>`) or via the Linear API. |
| `release_field`        | Custom field key/name    | Optional future write target for recording the shipped release on a Linear issue. Shell helpers warn that MCP/API access is required.                                                                                                                                         |
| `release_label_prefix` | Label prefix string      | Label fallback for release stamping. Defaults to `release/`, producing labels like `release/v1.2.0`. Shell helpers warn that MCP/API access is required to apply it.                                                                                                          |

When `project` is absent from `custom_fields` (or `custom_fields` itself is absent), the Portfolio Orchestrator queries all open items visible to the API token — which may include items from other codebases or projects — and emits a visible warning. Issue creation proceeds without a project association. This fallback is fully backward-compatible but is not recommended for multi-project Linear workspaces.

To set a project association, add the following to `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` under `issue_tracker`:

```yaml
issue_tracker:
  provider: linear
  custom_fields:
    project: my-linear-project-id
    release_label_prefix: release/
```

Read the value in a script using the `workflow_issue_tracker_custom_field` helper:

```bash
source scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh
project_id=$(workflow_issue_tracker_custom_field project)
```

Unrecognised keys in `custom_fields` are silently ignored by all current scripts.

### Release Stamping

Linear has no global first-class release object. The default workflow release
marker is a label named `release/vX.Y.Z`, using the configurable
`release_label_prefix` above. Teams that maintain a Linear custom field for
release tracking can set `release_field`; an MCP/API-backed implementation can
write that field during release cleanup.

Shell-only cleanup helpers cannot mutate Linear labels or custom fields directly.
They emit release-stamp guidance plus `TRACKER_ACTION=linear_mcp_or_api_required`
and exit non-zero unless `--best-effort` was explicitly accepted. The
orchestrator or a Linear MCP runner must apply the release label/custom field
and then transition every listed `TRACKER_ISSUES` item from `Merged` to
`Released` before reporting the release as complete.

## Workflow: Advancing Statuses

The **Portfolio Orchestrator**, **Work Item Runner**, or stage agent updates the Linear work item status at each stage transition:

| Action                                                                                          | Status transition                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human or Portfolio Orchestrator selects the item; Work Item Runner dispatches `product-manager` | → Writing Spec                                                  |
| Spec PR is human-ready (automation clean; ready for humans)                                     | → Spec in Review                                                |
| Spec PR merged                                                                                  | → Spec Ready                                                    |
| Human or Portfolio Orchestrator selects the item; Work Item Runner dispatches `tech-lead`       | → Writing Plan (Refactor items skip directly here from Backlog) |
| Plan PR is human-ready (automation clean)                                                       | → Plan in Review                                                |
| Plan PR merged                                                                                  | → Plan Ready                                                    |
| Human or Portfolio Orchestrator selects the item; Work Item Runner dispatches `developer`       | → In Development                                                |
| Feature/fix PR is human-ready (automation clean)                                                | → Development in Review                                         |
| Feature/fix PR merged to develop                                                                | → Merged                                                        |
| Release deployed to production                                                                  | → Released                                                      |

## Linear MCP Server (for Claude Code / Cursor)

To give your AI agent direct Linear access, configure the Linear MCP server:

```json
// .cursor/.mcp.json or equivalent MCP config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your-linear-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the MCP server, agents can read and update work items directly without the human copying tracker data into the chat.

---

## Without Linear

If you don't use Linear, the **Portfolio Orchestrator** asks the human:

> "What should I work on next? Please provide:
>
> - Feature name and slug
> - Path: Full Pipeline / Refactor / Fast Track / Hotfix
> - Priority context (if any)
> - Dependencies (if any)"

This works fine for small teams or early-stage projects.
