# Integration: CodeRabbit (Automated PR Review)

This document describes how to use [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai) as one automated PR reviewer tool in the workflow.

CodeRabbit is **optional**. The workflow functions without it. See [`integrations/pr-review-platform.md`](pr-review-platform.md) for the multi-platform loop and aggregation rules.

---

## What CodeRabbit Adds

- AST-based code analysis that catches race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors
- Severity-classified findings (Critical, Major, Minor) with inline suggestions
- Complements other reviewers by providing static analysis from a different angle

---

## Usage Modes

CodeRabbit supports three independent usage modes in this framework:

### CLI-only (Path A)

Use the CodeRabbit CLI locally before pushing. No GitHub App needed.

```bash
# Install
brew install coderabbit
# or: curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh

# Authenticate
coderabbit auth login

# In Claude Code
/plugin install coderabbit
/coderabbit:review
```

Use this mode by keeping `reviews.auto_review.enabled: false` in
`.coderabbit.yaml` and leaving `coderabbit` out of `review.on_draft.github` and
`review.on_ready.github`.

### CLI Step 7 reviewer (Path B)

Use the CodeRabbit CLI as a configured Step 7 platform without installing the
GitHub App. Add `coderabbit-cli` to `review.on_draft.github` or
`review.on_ready.github`:

```yaml
review:
  on_draft:
    github:
      - coderabbit-cli
  coderabbit_cli:
    rate_limit_policy: warn
```

The platform runs `cr --agent --base <pr-base>` when `cr` is installed. If `cr`
is absent and `coderabbit` is available, it runs
`coderabbit review --agent --base <pr-base>`. The PR base is read with
`gh pr view <number> --json baseRefName,headRefName`; if that lookup is
unavailable, the companion script falls back to `develop`.

The CLI path is intentionally not enabled by default. It requires local CLI
installation and authentication in the runner environment.

#### CLI Result Mapping

`scripts/development-workflow/coderabbit-cli-reviewer.sh` emits the same
companion-script contract as other CLI reviewers:

- `RESULT=clean` when agent JSON includes a recognized findings array and no
  blocking findings.
- `RESULT=needs_fixes` when one or more findings have blocking severity.
- `RESULT=skipped` with `REASON=unavailable`, `unauthorized`, `invalid_json`,
  `ambiguous_output`, `no_output`, `timeout`, or `rate_limited` when a fresh
  reliable review did not complete.
- `RESULT=escalate` with `REASON=rate_limited` when the rate-limit policy is
  strict.

The default rate-limit policy is `warn`, which records
`RESULT=skipped`, `REASON=rate_limited`, and `DISPLAY_RESULT=rate_limited`.
Set `CODERABBIT_CLI_RATE_LIMIT_POLICY=strict` or configure
`review.coderabbit_cli.rate_limit_policy: strict` to stop readiness on rate
limit instead.

`coderabbit-cli` does not post GitHub review threads in this MVP, so
`bot_login_for_platform coderabbit-cli` returns empty. The script-owned
Automated Reviewer Loop Summary is the durable evidence. A skipped CLI result
must be reported as unavailable or rate-limited evidence, not as "CodeRabbit CLI
found no issues."

### GitHub App PR reviewer (Path C)

To enable CodeRabbit as a Step 7 automated PR reviewer platform:

1. Install the CodeRabbit GitHub App on the repository.
2. Set `reviews.auto_review.enabled: true` in `.coderabbit.yaml`.
3. Add `coderabbit` to `review.on_draft.github` or `review.on_ready.github` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`.

The `coderabbit` App platform remains separate from `coderabbit-cli`. It uses
the `coderabbitai[bot]` review/comment evidence path described below.

CodeRabbit is an opt-in reviewer in this template repository. Auto-review is
disabled in the template default so the App does not review every PR or consume
review quota unless the repository explicitly opts in with both configuration
changes above.

When several PRs are queued, trigger CodeRabbit one PR at a time. CodeRabbit's
included allowance is based on trigger attempts, and parallel `@coderabbitai`
requests can spend the same hourly quota without producing additional reviews.
The reviewer loop reports `CODERABBIT_TRIGGER_ATTEMPTS` and
`CODERABBIT_REVIEWS_RECEIVED` so the attempt-to-review ratio is visible in the
run summary.

---

## Step 7a — Internal Reviewer (Draft PRs)

CodeRabbit can act as a Step 7a internal reviewer. Step 7a determines
availability and applies policy while the PR is still draft, then converts a
draft PR immediately before dispatch when CodeRabbit is configured. This keeps
the availability decision read-only and prevents a blocked gate from changing
the PR state.

### Configuration

Add `coderabbit` to `review.on_draft.runner` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
review:
  on_draft:
    runner:
      - claude
      - coderabbit
```

The conditional draft conversion below enables CodeRabbit dispatch; it does not approve the gate. All selected reviewers must APPROVE before final advancement. Reviewers run sequentially in configured order.

### Draft conversion

`reviews.auto_review.enabled: true` must be set in `.coderabbit.yaml`. Draft
restriction is not an unreachability condition: after availability and policy
permit dispatch, Step 7a converts a draft PR when CodeRabbit is configured so
that it cannot review drafts (`reviews.auto_review.drafts: false`, or the
absent default). When `drafts: true`, Step 7a preserves the draft state until
normal approval.

```yaml
reviews:
  auto_review:
    enabled: true
```

### Invocation

After the proceed decision and any required conversion, CodeRabbit auto-reviews
on push when `auto_review.enabled` is `true`. No trigger comment is needed.
The runner waits for a `coderabbitai[bot]` review posted after the HEAD commit
timestamp. This is the Step 7a dispatch path; the Step 7 external-review loop
remains separate.

### Severity Classification

Findings are classified using the same severity matrix as [Step 7](#blocking-vs-suggestion-classification). For Step 7a, only `Critical` and `Major` findings are blocking — the runner applies fixes and re-runs the internal review cycle. `Minor`, `Low`, and unmarked findings are non-blocking suggestions that the runner may optionally address but that do not prevent Step 7a from approving.

### Fix-Cycle Limit

CodeRabbit as an internal reviewer is subject to the same `max_internal_review_cycles` limit as other internal reviewers (default: 5). When the cycle count reaches the limit with unresolved blocking findings, Step 7a escalates to human rather than continuing to loop.

### Availability Check

Step 7a workflow configuration validation requires PyYAML in the `python3`
interpreter used by the gate for every reviewer. CodeRabbit enablement uses the
same dependency. The workflow CI provisions `PyYAML==6.0.2`, and
`scripts/cloud-agent-install.sh` provisions the distribution package. For local
use, install that pinned version in a virtual environment and put its `bin`
directory on PATH before running the gate. Missing PyYAML during workflow
configuration parsing produces `policy-unreadable` with setup guidance. An
isolated CodeRabbit parser import failure remains `check-inconclusive`. Neither
path installs packages.

The entire `.coderabbit.yaml` is validated with a safe YAML loader, including
unrelated sections. Syntax errors, unsafe tags, and duplicate explicit mapping
keys are rejected. Valid aliases, flow collections, multiline values, and merge
defaults with explicit overrides are supported. Enablement accepts typed
`true`/`True`/`TRUE` and `false`/`False`/`FALSE`; quoted spellings, numbers, and
YAML 1.1 `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` are not boolean enablement settings.

Step 7a calls `resolve-reviewer-availability.sh` once, under its fixed bounded
budget, before dispatching anybody. For CodeRabbit the helper checks
`reviews.auto_review.enabled: true` and reads the newest repository issue
comments page for `coderabbitai[bot]`. Bot activity is a bounded
repository-activity proxy, not proof of current installation or per-review
enablement: a complete short unmatched page is `prerequisite-missing`, while a
full unmatched page is `check-inconclusive`. The helper validates policy and configuration first and blocks invalid inputs
before any probe. During the CodeRabbit probe, an unreadable or rejected
`.coderabbit.yaml` is `check-inconclusive`: repair the file using the reported
read or syntax error, then re-run. A missing file or a readable disabled setting
is `prerequisite-missing`; a probe timeout remains `check-inconclusive` with
execution guidance. For valid configuration it classifies capability, then applies
the resolved reachability policy; the gate consumes that returned outcome.

The proxy can be false Reachable after an App is removed and false Unreachable
for a new or review-only installation. If CodeRabbit was classified reachable
and dispatch then fails, errors, exhausts quota, or times out, report a review
failure under either policy; do not reclassify it as unavailable.

## Setup (Path C only)

### 1. Install the CodeRabbit GitHub App

Go to [coderabbit.ai](https://www.coderabbit.ai) and install the GitHub App on your repository.

### 2. Enable auto-review in `.coderabbit.yaml`

```yaml
reviews:
  auto_review:
    enabled: true
    # true only if you list coderabbit in review.on_draft.github
    drafts: false
    # must include every base branch your PRs target, including develop-<slug>
    base_branches:
      - develop
      - develop-.*
    # 1 makes CodeRabbit pause after each reviewer-loop fix commit
    auto_pause_after_reviewed_commits: 10
```

`.coderabbit.yaml` must agree with the lifecycle bucket you pick in step 3. CodeRabbit declines to review — and posts a **"Review skipped" banner** instead — in three configurations that are easy to create unintentionally:

| Configuration                                                       | When it bites                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto_review.enabled: false`                                        | Every PR. This is the template's shipped default.                |
| `auto_review.drafts: false` with `coderabbit` in `on_draft.github`  | Every draft PR, i.e. the entire draft gate.                      |
| `auto_review.base_branches` missing the PR's base                   | Sub-item PRs into a `develop-<slug>` integration branch.         |

`pr-review-loop.sh` treats that banner as **no review**, not as a completed review: it keeps polling, posts an explicit `@coderabbitai review` nudge (which works even when auto review is off), and if the banner is still standing when the poll window closes it exits `RESULT=escalate` with `REASON=review_skipped_banner`. That reason string is deliberately distinct from `rate_limit_max_retries` — it means "fix `.coderabbit.yaml`", not "wait for vendor quota".

`auto_pause_after_reviewed_commits` deserves its own attention. It pauses auto review once that many reviewed commits arrive without human interaction. At `1`, every reviewer-loop fix commit trips the pause banner and costs a full poll cycle while the loop posts `@coderabbitai resume`. Convergence routinely takes several fix rounds, so set the cap above a normal round count.

### 3. Add to `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`

```yaml
review:
  on_draft:
    github:
      - coderabbit
```

Use `on_ready.github` instead when CodeRabbit should review the finished PR rather than the draft. That is the cheaper placement against an hourly quota: draft revisions are still moving, so reviewing them spends quota on code that is about to change.

### 4. Verify Auto-Review Is Active and Configured in the Workflow

Push a commit to an open PR and confirm that CodeRabbit posts review comments. The bot posts as `coderabbitai[bot]`. CodeRabbit should also be listed in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`; otherwise the App may post findings that the workflow loop does not wait for.

If the first comment CodeRabbit posts is a "Review skipped" banner rather than a walkthrough, the App is installed correctly but the configuration in step 2 does not cover this PR — re-check it against the table above before assuming the integration is broken.

### 5. Size the rate-limit tolerance for your plan

CodeRabbit's quota resets on an **hourly** boundary. The loop waits `CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT` seconds (default `900`) and retries up to `CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES` times (default `4`), so the shipped defaults cover a full 60-minute reset window before escalating. Lower them only if you would rather escalate quickly than wait; raising them past an hour buys nothing, since a quota that has not reset in an hour indicates a spending cap rather than a rate limit.

### 6. Branch-in-force configuration, and the reviewer preflight (#1561)

**The configuration CodeRabbit actually reads for a pull request is the copy of `.coderabbit.yaml` on that pull request's own branch (its head), not the copy on the branch the pull request targets.** This is CodeRabbit's own resolution behavior, not something this workflow chooses — the same rule `pr-review-loop.sh` already assumes when it fetches the pull request's `baseRefName` before reading `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` from `origin/<that base>`, so the *shared* reviewer list and each platform's *own* configuration can read from different refs by design.

Two consequences follow directly:

- **A fix takes effect on the very pull request that carries it.** If `.coderabbit.yaml` is broken or misconfigured on a branch, editing it on that same branch repairs that pull request's own review immediately — no merge to the integration branch is required first.
- **A branch can silently carry a configuration that diverges from the repository's intended review policy.** Nothing else notices this on its own; a branch that edits `.coderabbit.yaml` (deliberately or by accident) gets that edited behavior for its own pull request, and only its own pull request, until it merges.

This was confirmed live: PR #1532 edited `.coderabbit.yaml` on its own branch and observed CodeRabbit's review behavior change on that same PR before merge, establishing the branch-in-force rule empirically rather than by assumption.

The **reviewer preflight** (`scripts/development-workflow/reviewer-preflight.sh`, invoked by Protocol 91 before an item's first mutation) cross-checks this configuration before dispatch rather than after a review silently declines. A preflight run before any branch exists is checked only against the base branch the run targets, and cannot see a divergence a not-yet-created branch will introduce; a preflight run against an existing branch or pull request reads CodeRabbit's own configuration from that branch's or pull request's own copy, exactly as CodeRabbit itself will. The preflight decides whether CodeRabbit *can* review — a configuration-coherence verdict — not whether its GitHub App installation is still live; see [`pr-review-platform.md`](pr-review-platform.md) for how that distinction relates to Step 7a's own reachability check.

The preflight reports four distinct disagreement cases for CodeRabbit, each with its own remedy:

| Case | `reviews.auto_review.*` setting | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic review turned off | `enabled: false` (or the key absent) | Set `enabled: true` in `.coderabbit.yaml`, or remove `coderabbit` from `review.on_draft.github` / `review.on_ready.github` in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`, and re-run. |
| Stage not covered | `drafts: false` while `coderabbit` is listed as a draft-stage reviewer | Set `drafts: true` in `.coderabbit.yaml`, or move `coderabbit` to a stage its own configuration covers, and re-run. This case does not fire when an existing workflow adjustment (for example the internal review gate's draft-to-ready conversion) already resolves the mismatch before CodeRabbit is dispatched. |
| Base branch not covered | The item's targeted base is not in `base_branches` | Add the targeted base to `base_branches` in `.coderabbit.yaml`, or narrow this machine's reviewer list through `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` to exclude `coderabbit` for this item, and re-run. |
| Not a supported reviewer | `coderabbit` misspelled or listed in a bucket that does not support it | Correct the value, or remove it from the bucket that names it, and re-run. |

The preflight reports a disagreement; it never edits `.coderabbit.yaml` on the operator's behalf.

## Step 7 — CodeRabbit-Specific Implementation

The **Work Item Runner's** Step 7 (Automated Reviewer Loop) requires platform-specific commands. Below are the CodeRabbit adapter details used by the shared helper.

### Preferred helper

When possible, call the repository helper instead of re-implementing the loop inline:

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh <pr_number> --branch <branch_name> --platform coderabbit
```

It encapsulates the polling, comment classification, and stable aggregate `RESULT=` output used by the **Work Item Runner** (and by the **Portfolio Orchestrator** when it supervises item-level runs).

### Bot identity

CodeRabbit posts as `coderabbitai[bot]`. Use this login to filter its comments and reviews from human activity.

### Step 7.1 — Trigger a re-review

**No routine trigger needed.** CodeRabbit auto-reviews on every push when `auto_review.enabled` is `true` in `.coderabbit.yaml`, so the normal path posts nothing and there is no `REVIEW_COMMENT_ID`.

The helper does post one **conditional** trigger. When no CodeRabbit activity has appeared after `CODERABBIT_NO_TRIGGER_TIMEOUT` seconds — because CodeRabbit stayed silent after a push, or because it declined with a `Review skipped` banner — the loop posts `@coderabbitai review`, which works even when auto review is disabled. This is bounded by `CODERABBIT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES`, shared with the rate-limit retry path so there is a single knob for total nudge attempts. A separate `@coderabbitai resume` is posted for the pause banner.

### Step 7.2 — Detect review completion

CodeRabbit signals completion by posting a review (typically `COMMENTED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`) on the PR after analyzing the pushed commit.

The helper script checks for a CodeRabbit review on each poll iteration. If a review from `coderabbitai[bot]` is found submitted after the HEAD commit timestamp, the review is considered complete and the script proceeds to Phase 3.

As a secondary signal, the script also checks for CodeRabbit issue comments (e.g., the PR summary comment) as an **activity indicator** — this is used only to distinguish "CodeRabbit is active but hasn't finished" from "CodeRabbit didn't review this HEAD at all" when the timeout is reached.

Four kinds of CodeRabbit comment are explicitly **excluded** from that activity signal, because each one is CodeRabbit announcing that it did *not* review: the `Reviews paused` banner, a `rate limit` notice, a `Reviews resumed` acknowledgement, and the `Review skipped` banner (`CODERABBIT_SKIP_BANNER_RE`, which keys on the `skip review by coderabbit.ai` HTML marker and the banner's markdown heading rather than a bare "review skipped" substring, so a walkthrough using that phrase in prose is not mistaken for a banner). Counting any of them as activity would break the poll loop into Phase 3, which would then collect zero inline comments and report the PR clean.

| Result                                                     | Action                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CodeRabbit review found after HEAD commit                  | Review complete — proceed to Step 7.3                           |
| No review yet and `elapsed < max_wait`                     | Not finished yet — wait another `poll_interval` and poll again  |
| `elapsed >= max_wait` and only a `Review skipped` banner   | Escalate — `REASON=review_skipped_banner` (fix `.coderabbit.yaml`) |
| `elapsed >= max_wait` and a pause or rate-limit banner     | Escalate — `REASON=rate_limit_max_retries`                      |
| `elapsed >= max_wait` and no CodeRabbit activity detected  | Stale findings recovery, then skip as `no_review` if none found |
| `elapsed >= max_wait` and CodeRabbit activity was detected | Timeout — escalate to human                                     |

### Step 7.3 — Fetch inline comments and reviews

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"coderabbitai[bot]\" and .created_at > \"$since_iso\" and .in_reply_to_id == null) | {path, line, body}]"
```

Additionally, `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews posted by `coderabbitai[bot]` after the HEAD commit are also fetched from the reviews endpoint and counted as blocking, regardless of the emoji severity marker in their body. This matches the behavior of the other platform adapters.

### Blocking vs. suggestion classification

Unlike Devin (where all findings are blocking), CodeRabbit inline comments include severity markers that determine blocking status:

| Severity marker       | Classification            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `🔴 Critical`         | Blocking                  |
| `🟠 Major`            | Blocking                  |
| `🟡 Minor`            | Suggestion (non-blocking) |
| `🟢 Low` or no marker | Suggestion (non-blocking) |

The adapter parses the comment body for these emoji+label patterns. Comments without a recognized severity marker default to suggestion.

### Reply thread handling

CodeRabbit posts findings as inline comments on code lines. The adapter filters out reply comments (`in_reply_to_id != null`) to avoid double-counting a finding and its reply as separate items. Only top-level inline comments are counted.

### Resolved comment handling

When CodeRabbit detects fixes in subsequent commits, it may post a reply starting with `✅` on the original finding.

**Stale-findings recovery** (where the entire PR history is scanned without a timestamp bound) is the only path that performs explicit `✅`-reply filtering: it collects the IDs of all bot replies starting with `✅` and excludes their parent comments from the stale blocking count — the same `jq -s` pattern as the Devin adapter.

**Phase 1 and Phase 3 do not perform explicit resolved-comment filtering.** They rely on the `since_iso` timestamp bound instead: only comments posted after the HEAD commit are fetched. Because CodeRabbit posts findings and `✅` resolution replies in separate review cycles (triggered by different pushes), a resolved finding's original comment will have a `created_at` before `since_iso` and will not appear in Phase 1 or Phase 3 queries. Reply comments (`in_reply_to_id != null`) are always excluded from direct counting regardless of phase.
