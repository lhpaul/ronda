# Review Doctrine

This catalogue lists recurring finding **shapes** worth looking for during
review. It is **not** the set of things worth reporting — withhold no real
finding because it fits no catalogued pattern. When you match a pattern below,
**name it** in your finding so later readers can tell doctrine-driven findings
from the rest.

## Adding patterns

Each entry has four parts in this order: a level-3 heading (pattern name), then
exactly one `**Shape**:`, one `**Example**:` and one `**Detect**:` paragraph.
Remove every trace of the specific incident — no pull request number, no issue
number, no person, no title, no path from the incident. Paths in this guidance
are fine; paths inside entries are not.

Before opening a pull request, confirm the entry reads generally — no person's
name, no document title, no wording that only makes sense to someone who saw
the original incident. See also the Workflow Policy Review Checklist in
`REVIEW.md`.

The catalogue is bounded at 12,000 bytes (`REVIEW_DOCTRINE_MAX_BYTES` in
`scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`). When the bound is reached,
**merge or remove a pattern — never raise the bound in the same change that
breaches it.** Raising the bound is a deliberate, separately reviewed change to
the doctrine contract.

Example development-folder paths like `docs/specs/developments/` appear only in
this guidance, never inside pattern entries.

### Criteria/matrix mismatch

**Shape**: A table that enumerates decisions disagrees with the criteria stated
above it, or omits a combination those criteria admit.

**Example**: Acceptance criteria require both "logged in" and "not logged in"
outcomes, but the decision matrix has rows only for the logged-in case.

**Detect**: For each matrix row, can you point to the criterion it implements?
For each criterion combination the prose admits, is there a row?

### Opt-out ambiguity

**Shape**: A way to disable or bypass behavior has its source of truth stated in
more than one place, or in none.

**Example**: One section says "set `FEATURE=0` to disable" while another says
"unset `FEATURE` to disable."

**Detect**: Where is the authoritative opt-out named, and do all other mentions
agree with it?

### Parser-surface conflict

**Shape**: A rule about how input is recognised conflicts with the syntax the
document elsewhere requires, or assumes a capability the stated tooling lacks.

**Example**: A protocol requires comma-separated values but the parser section
documents only space-delimited tokens.

**Detect**: Does the syntax examples use match what the parser rule accepts?
Does the stated tooling support every construct the rule requires?

### Trigger ambiguity

**Shape**: A condition that starts behavior does not say what happens when its
inputs are absent, empty, or malformed.

**Example**: "When the flag is set, run the check" with no row for an unset or
invalid flag value.

**Detect**: For each input the trigger names, is the outcome defined when that
input is missing, empty, or invalid?

### Example contradicting rule

**Shape**: A worked example demonstrates something the rule beside it forbids,
or omits a step the rule requires.

**Example**: The rule says "always emit a reason" but the example output omits
the reason field entirely.

**Detect**: Does the example satisfy every requirement stated in the adjacent
rule, with no extra steps the rule forbids?

### Enumeration treated as contract

**Shape**: A delta from a previously agreed list is treated as a defect in
itself, with no statement of what the missing entries were protecting.

**Example**: A revision ships fewer rows than an earlier list enumerated, and
the review blocks on the count alone, without naming what the removed rows
exercised or what now goes unverified.

**Detect**: For each entry called missing, can you name the behavior it
exercised and the failure that now goes unnoticed? This question does not
apply when the source document explicitly marked the list binding — a
binding list's delta is blocking on its own terms, with no need to name what
it protected.

### Stateful-contract outcome gaps

**Shape**: A decision matrix, state table, lifecycle, or precedence-rule set
does not say which rule wins when several fire together, does not say which
evidence revision governs when recency decides, or has a path that ends in
none of the document's stated outcome classes (for example neither proceed,
wait, nor escalate). See also `Criteria/matrix mismatch` and `Trigger
ambiguity` for overlapping rows, missing states, and malformed or unknown
input handling.

**Example**: Two rules can both fire on the same input, and the document
never states which one takes precedence; or a table cites "the latest
evidence" without saying which of two conflicting timestamps counts as
latest; or a row's next action is left unstated, so a reader cannot tell
whether the case proceeds, waits, or escalates.

**Detect**: When rules or rows can fire together, does the document state the
order? When recency decides an outcome, does the document name which
evidence revision or timestamp governs? Does every path end in one of the
document's stated outcome classes, with no gap where it could neither
proceed, wait, nor escalate?
