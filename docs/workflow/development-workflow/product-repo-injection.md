# Product Repository Injection

Use this guide from a product repository checkout when the repository should
receive the minimal workflow integration surface for hub-routed work.

## Product Repo Mode

Run location: product repository checkout.

The versioned `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` identifies the product repository and its
hub. Keep it free of machine-local paths and secret material.

```yaml
schema_version: 2
mode: product_repo

product_repo:
  workflow_hub:
    github_repo: example/faind-workflow-hub
```

Local checkout paths and credential references belong in the hub operator's
`.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml`, not in product repository versioned config.

## Role-Aware Sync Selection

Run location: product repository checkout.

When sync-template reads `sync-manifest.yaml`, product repositories select:

- `shared`
- `product_repo_injection`

Product repositories skip:

- `hub_only`

Preview the manifest selection before applying a template sync:

```bash
python3 scripts/development-workflow/select-sync-manifest-entries.py \
  --manifest sync-manifest.yaml \
  --role product_repo
```

Then run sync-template in dry-run mode:

```text
/sync-template --local=../ai-dev-framework-template --dry-run
```

The dry-run summary should show selected and skipped entries before any file is
applied.

## What Product Repos Must Not Receive

Product repositories must not receive hub-owned workflow state unless a future
workflow contract explicitly marks a specific file as product-repo injection:

- Hub tracker state.
- Historical specs.
- Implementation plans.
- Workflow protocols.
- Hub orchestration scripts.
- Hub-only runbooks.

Product repositories may receive shared docs, local integration wrappers, config
schema comments, and injection-safe files declared with
`product_repo_injection`.

For product-owned release work, product repositories may also receive the
minimum runtime helpers needed to validate non-secret release configuration,
run product PR reviewer and CI loops, and record product branch or PR cleanup
evidence:

- `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-config-resolver.py`
- `scripts/development-workflow/validate-workflow-config.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh`

These files are product release runtime surfaces, not hub coordination state.
Historical specs, implementation plans, workflow protocols, hub orchestration
scripts, delivery coordination runbooks, and hub tracker state remain excluded.

For multi-repository release adoption, product repositories provide
product-owned release, CI, deployment, and cleanup evidence to the hub. They do
not receive the hub adoption runbook, historical hub baselines, or delivery
coordination state through product repository injection.

## Apply Injection Safely

Run location: product repository checkout.

1. Confirm the product repository is on the intended base branch.
2. Run sync-template dry-run and inspect selected/skipped scopes.
3. Apply approved changes only after reviewing divergent local files.
4. Commit the injected files through the product repository's normal PR flow.
5. Keep `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` and any credential material untracked.

## Troubleshooting

### Unexpected Hub Files In Product Repo Output

Symptom: dry-run output includes `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/`
or `scripts/development-workflow/` as selected entries.

Confirm from the product repository checkout:

```bash
python3 scripts/development-workflow/select-sync-manifest-entries.py \
  --manifest sync-manifest.yaml \
  --role product_repo
```

Safe repair:

- Verify the repository declares `mode: product_repo`.
- Verify the manifest entry is not incorrectly marked
  `product_repo_injection`.
- Stop before applying if hub-owned files are selected unexpectedly.

### Divergent Local Files

Symptom: sync-template dry-run reports local differences for selected files.

Safe repair:

- Review the diff before applying.
- Preserve product-specific content.
- Apply only the template-owned sections for mixed-content files.

### Missing Local Config

Symptom: validation cannot resolve the hub or local product checkout.

Safe repair:

- Keep product identity in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`.
- Put machine-local paths only in `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` in the hub
  operator environment.
