# AI Agent Model Configuration

This document explains the _model tier_ assigned to each agent, the rationale behind each choice, and how to override them when needed.

This template is designed to be **LLM-provider agnostic**. The concrete model IDs you use will depend on:

- Which provider(s) you have access to (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- Which agent runner you use (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, CI runner, etc.)
- Your cost/latency targets and context-window needs

---

## Model Tiers

Use a small set of tiers and map them to your provider’s current model lineup.

- **`economy`**: fast + cheap; good for mechanical coordination and checklist-style work
- **`balanced`**: general-purpose; best cost/quality default for most writing + coding tasks
- **`premium`**: highest reasoning reliability; reserve for architecture and high-leverage planning

If you prefer different names (`small/medium/large`, `fast/standard/pro`, etc.), keep the same intent.

## Agent Assignments (Tier-Based)

| Agent                          | Tier       | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `orchestrator`                 | `economy`  | **Portfolio Orchestrator**. Reads state, builds batches, and dispatches Work Item Runners; mechanical coordination that should stay fast and cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `item-orchestrator`            | `balanced` | **Work Item Runner**. Single-item control loop supervises review-fix-review cycles where parsing findings, determining correct fixes, and verifying them requires capable reasoning. Economy models struggle with multi-step reasoning in fix loops; balanced (sonnet minimum) is required.                                                                |
| `automated-reviewer-loop`      | `economy`  | Runs review + CI loop for a PR; mechanical coordination like the orchestration agents, no deep reasoning required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `product-manager`              | `premium`  | Spec writing is the highest-leverage task in the pipeline — a weak spec cascades into worse plans and worse implementations. While the spec template provides scaffolding, the creative and judgment-heavy work of capturing requirements, edge cases, and acceptance criteria benefits from deeper reasoning that a premium model provides more reliably. |
| `spec-reviewer`                | `balanced` | Review against a checklist. A balanced model is well within the capability required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `tech-lead`                    | `premium`  | Architecture decisions and implementation planning are the highest-reasoning tasks in the workflow. A weak plan is expensive to fix downstream — this is where a premium model pays for itself.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `implementation-plan-reviewer` | `balanced` | Validating a plan against a spec and codebase is review work; no architectural invention required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `developer`                    | `balanced` | Code generation at scale. A balanced model is typically the cost/quality sweet spot for coding tasks, especially with a strong spec + plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `code-reviewer`                | `balanced` | Code review against known standards and a completed spec. A balanced model is capable here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `project-setup`                | `balanced` | Structured onboarding conversation with clear protocol guidance. A balanced model is sufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `smoke-tester`                 | `balanced` | Executes the smoke test runbook using browser automation. A balanced model is sufficient for following step-by-step testing instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `retrospective`                | `balanced` | **Retrospective Analyst**. Reads PR metadata and git history, synthesizes findings across multiple PRs, and identifies workflow patterns; the synthesis and pattern-recognition work requires a capable model — economy tier produces shallow, low-signal retrospectives.                                                                                  |

### Runner Notes

Use the tier names as stable policy and map them to whatever your current runner and provider support.

- In Claude Code, map the tier to the model family or explicit model ID configured in `.claude/agents/*.md`.
- In Cursor, set `.cursor/agents/*.md` to `auto` for ordinary coordination and QA agents, and pin an explicit high-reasoning model for agents that author or deeply review specs, plans, and code. Those `model:` fields are the source of truth for Cursor runs (see "Cursor model source of truth" below).
- In Codex, keep skills tier-based (`economy`, `balanced`, `premium`) and map the active runner model to the current OpenAI model family.
- In any runner, prefer keeping the tier intent stable even when provider model names change.

### Claude Code model defaults (template)

Claude Code agents pin concrete model IDs in `.claude/agents/*.md`.

| Tier | Claude Code `model` (template default) | Used for |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `economy` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Portfolio orchestration and mechanical reviewer-loop coordination |
| `balanced` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Implementation, review, setup, QA, smoke testing, item orchestration, and retrospectives |
| `premium` | `claude-opus-5` | Spec writing and technical planning |

### Codex / OpenAI model mapping (template)

Codex skills intentionally store recommended tiers rather than concrete model IDs. Map those tiers to the current OpenAI family in the Codex runner or model picker:

| Tier | OpenAI model mapping | Used for |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------- |
| `economy` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Mechanical coordination and high-volume checklist work |
| `balanced` | `gpt-5.6-terra` | Implementation, review, setup, QA, item orchestration, and retrospectives |
| `premium` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Spec writing and technical planning |

### Cursor model source of truth

For Cursor runs, the `model:` field in each checked-in `.cursor/agents/<agent>.md`
file is authoritative. The "Cursor model defaults (template)" table below is
the template's starting point and an example of the tier split. It does not
override a repository's local pins, and it does not describe what a downstream
repository actually runs.

Downstream repositories may pin other model families, such as Grok, Composer,
or a provider-specific ID the template never ships. Those pins must be honored
as written, including a checked-in `inherit`. No table in this document, the
Claude Code defaults table included, is a substitute for the value an agent
file resolves to.

Before dispatching a Cursor stage subagent, an orchestrating role (`/run-item`,
`/run-items`, `/run-epic`, the item or portfolio orchestrator, or a parent
running inline) resolves the target agent's model from the checkout being run:

1. If `.cursor/agents/<agent>.md` exists, use its `model:` value.
2. If it does not exist, Cursor resolves the agent through the location
   precedence described after "Cursor model field values" below; use the
   `model:` value of the file that resolves, and name that file in the run
   summary.
3. If no agent file resolves, or the resolved file has no `model:` field,
   report the gap in the run summary. Do not fill it from any table in this
   document.

A one-off override from "Option 1" below changes the model only when the run
actually dispatches it. Creating a duplicate agent file (for example
`developer-premium.md`) does not change which agent `/run-item` dispatches: the
run still dispatches the standard role (`developer`) and uses that role's pin.
The duplicate applies only when the human explicitly names it as the stage
agent to dispatch for that run, and the run summary records that substitution.
Switching the Composer model affects only agents whose resolved `model:` is
`inherit`.

### Cursor model defaults (template)

These are the values this template ships in `.cursor/agents/*.md`. Read the
local files for the values in force; see "Cursor model source of truth" above.

Set models in `.cursor/agents/*.md` so subagents do not inherit the parent Composer model during long orchestration or review-fix loops. The template default is `fast` for economy coordination agents, `auto` for lower-risk balanced agents, and `cursor-grok-4.5-high` for complex authoring and review work. If Cursor's model picker exposes Grok 4.5 under a different local ID, update the pinned value but preserve the same split. See the Cursor model field value guide below for when `inherit` is acceptable.

The `fast` economy assignments below are intentional for high-volume orchestration loops where predictable cost and latency matter more than deep reasoning. The remaining `auto` assignments are for lower-risk balanced agents that primarily verify or run checklist-style workflows; Cursor may route those runs to different concrete models over time, so their cost and latency can vary by workspace settings. Balanced agents that author production code or perform deep review stay pinned to Grok 4.5 High to keep complex reasoning capacity predictable.

Cursor Task/subagent runs consume quota for the model selected by the subagent's
`model` field. Setting the Composer to a cheaper or more expensive model does
not automatically change a pinned subagent. Treat `fast`, `auto`, pinned IDs,
and `inherit` as quota controls:

- `fast` is the predictable low-cost path for high-volume coordination.
- `auto` lets Cursor choose the backing model, so quality, latency, and quota
  usage can change with workspace settings.
- A pinned model gives predictable capability and predictable quota class, but
  it can exhaust that model's quota sooner during long review-fix loops.
- `inherit` intentionally spends whatever model the Composer currently uses;
  use it only when that inheritance is the desired override.

| Agent | Tier | Cursor `model` (template default) |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| `orchestrator` | `economy` | `fast` |
| `automated-reviewer-loop` | `economy` | `fast` |
| `item-orchestrator` | `balanced` | `auto` |
| `developer` | `balanced` | `cursor-grok-4.5-high` |
| `code-reviewer` | `balanced` | `cursor-grok-4.5-high` |
| `spec-reviewer` | `balanced` | `cursor-grok-4.5-high` |
| `implementation-plan-reviewer` | `balanced` | `cursor-grok-4.5-high` |
| `smoke-tester` | `balanced` | `auto` |
| `retrospective` | `balanced` | `auto` |
| `project-setup` | `balanced` | `auto` |
| `design-reviewer` | `balanced` | `auto` |
| `post-merge-qa` | `balanced` | `auto` |
| `product-manager` | `premium` | `cursor-grok-4.5-high` |
| `tech-lead` | `premium` | `cursor-grok-4.5-high` |

Update pinned IDs and tier mappings when your provider deprecates a model; keep the tier intent stable.

### Cursor dispatch profiles

Applies only in a Cursor environment; other runners are unchanged. Profile
selection is declared, not automatically detected, per
`integrations/cursor-dispatch-profiles.md` (the canonical, normative source).
For an environment or orchestration layer whose handoff behavior has not been
directly observed, the profile recorded below is an explicit assumption, not
an observed fact, and takes the more restrictive of the profiles under
consideration until confirmed by observation.

**Profile and evidence marker per environment x layer**:

| Environment | Layer | Profile | Evidence marker | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor Desktop | Portfolio | Native handoff (`cursor-native-handoff`) | confirmed by observation | The two-hop handoff holds on desktop, naming the portfolio orchestrator |
| Cursor Desktop | Epic | Native handoff (`cursor-native-handoff`) | confirmed by observation | Same, naming the epic runner |
| Cursor Desktop | Item | Native handoff (`cursor-native-handoff`) | confirmed by observation | Same, naming the work item runner |
| Cursor Remote Control | Portfolio | Parent orchestrated (`cursor-parent-orchestrated`) | explicit assumption | Onward-handoff failure is recorded only environment-wide ("frequently"); no portfolio-layer case is recorded, so onward capability cannot be confirmed at this layer and the conservative default applies. At this layer the current context absorbs the portfolio and item layers and runs items one at a time (Protocol 90 Step 4 Cursor-scoped paragraph) |
| Cursor Remote Control | Epic | Parent orchestrated (`cursor-parent-orchestrated`) | explicit assumption | No epic-layer case is recorded; onward capability is unconfirmed, so the conservative default applies |
| Cursor Remote Control | Item | Parent orchestrated (`cursor-parent-orchestrated`) | confirmed by observation | The recorded incident (one context doing orchestration and implementation at once) is an item-layer case |
| Cursor Cloud Agents | Portfolio | Inline fallback (`cursor-inline-fallback`) | explicit assumption | Nothing observed for this environment, so initial handoff cannot be confirmed and the matrix assigns inline fallback |
| Cursor Cloud Agents | Epic | Inline fallback (`cursor-inline-fallback`) | explicit assumption | Same |
| Cursor Cloud Agents | Item | Inline fallback (`cursor-inline-fallback`) | explicit assumption | Same |

Consequence for Cloud Agents: a mutating bounded run stops with
`dispatch_handoff_unavailable` recording that initial handoff is unconfirmed,
rather than absorbing a role. An operator who observes and records in run
output that initial handoff is available makes the **next** run declare
afresh against the confirmed facts (parent orchestrated if onward handoff is
unavailable or unconfirmed, native handoff if both are available); a run
never upgrades in place. The same applies to a Remote Control portfolio or
epic layer once an operator observes and records the onward fact for that
layer: the next run declares afresh.

**Model assignment per environment x layer** (evidence marker in the last
column; the tiers come from the Agent Assignments table above — Portfolio
Orchestrator `economy`/`fast`, Work Item Runner `balanced`/`auto`; the epic
layer has no dedicated agent file, so it takes the Work Item Runner tier
(`balanced`) as its floor; stage roles always keep their own configured
models under every profile):

| Environment | Portfolio layer model | Epic layer model | Item layer model | Evidence marker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor Desktop | Portfolio Orchestrator agent's own model: `economy` / `fast` | Epic-layer role's model: `balanced` / `auto` | Work Item Runner agent's own model: `balanced` / `auto` | explicit assumption (the framework documents that a Cursor subagent's frontmatter `model` applies on native handoff, but no model observation is recorded) |
| Cursor Remote Control | The floor is the highest tier among the layers the run absorbs: a `/run-work` scan absorbs nothing (observing), so the `economy` floor applies (`fast` where selectable); `/run-items` absorbs the portfolio **and** item layers, so the `balanced` floor applies (`auto` where selectable) | Absorbing current context must run at `balanced` or higher, `auto` where selectable | Absorbing current context must run at `balanced` or higher, `auto` where selectable | explicit assumption at every layer (the remote session's model is not switched by role frontmatter, and no model observation is recorded) |
| Cursor Cloud Agents | No role absorbed (inline fallback, read-only): the session's own model reports findings; no role floor applies | Same as Cloud portfolio | Same as Cloud portfolio | explicit assumption (profile and model). When an operator later confirms initial handoff, the next run uses the Remote Control or Desktop row the confirmed facts assign, including its model floor |

Under `cursor-parent-orchestrated`, the absorbing context never uses `inherit`
as a substitute for the floor: if the session model is below the absorbed
role's tier, the declaration records the shortfall and the operator switches
the session model before the first mutating action. Under
`cursor-inline-fallback` no orchestration role is absorbed, so no role floor
applies. Unobserved environments use the more restrictive applicable profile
until an operator confirms otherwise in run output.

## Tool Restrictions

Agents only get `Bash` when they need it to carry a stage through branch creation, commits, pushes, PR creation, or readiness loops. Agents only get `Agent` when they need to dispatch sub-agents to handle stage-specific work.

## Overriding the Model for a Task

If a specific task is unusually complex and you want a `premium` model for the `developer` agent — or you want to cut costs and use `economy` for a trivial spec — override the model temporarily.

**Option 1 — In-session override (runner-specific):**
Use your runner’s “one-off model override” mechanism.

Claude Code example (if applicable):

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->
```bash
bash -lc 'claude --agent developer --model claude-opus-5'
```

**Cursor:**
Cursor subagents use the `model` field in `.cursor/agents/<agent>.md`. To override for a single run:

- Switch your Composer's model before invoking the subagent (e.g., `/developer`); this takes effect only for an agent whose `model:` is `inherit`, or
- Create a duplicate agent file (e.g., `developer-premium.md`) with a different `model` value, and explicitly name it as the stage agent to dispatch for that run (see "Cursor model source of truth")

Use this decision path before overriding Cursor models:

1. If the task matches the normal workflow role, keep the checked-in subagent
   model so the tier policy and quota expectations remain stable.
2. If a run is failing because the selected model lacks reasoning capacity,
   temporarily move only that role to the next higher tier or a pinned
   high-reasoning model.
3. If quota or latency is the blocker and the task is mechanical, temporarily
   move only that role to `fast` or `auto`.
4. If you need the subagent to follow the current Composer model for one run,
   use `inherit` deliberately and record why; do not leave long-running
   orchestrators, item runners, reviewer loops, or fix-loop agents on `inherit`.
5. After the one-off run, restore the repository's tier intent unless the team
   is intentionally changing the default for future work.

**Option 2 — Permanent change:**
Edit the model configuration for the agent:

- **Claude Code**: Edit the `model` field in `.claude/agents/*.md`
- **Cursor**: Edit the `model` field in `.cursor/agents/*.md` (values: `auto`, `fast`, `inherit`, or a specific model ID)

This affects all future invocations until changed back.

**Cursor model field values:**

- `fast`: Uses Cursor's fast model (template default for economy coordination agents where predictable cost and latency matter most)
- `auto`: Lets Cursor route to an appropriate model (template default for lower-risk balanced QA, setup, and retrospective agents)
- Pinned model ID: Uses that exact model (template default for complex authoring and review agents, e.g. `cursor-grok-4.5-high`)
- `inherit`: Uses the current Composer model — **discouraged** for orchestrators, item runners, fixer agents, and reviewer-loop agents because it leaks parent-session cost into long runs; reserve for intentional one-off overrides

**Precedence**: When multiple agent locations exist (`.cursor/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/`), Cursor uses `.cursor/agents/` first, then `.claude/agents/`, then `.codex/agents/`.

## Expected Run Durations

The table below shows the typical and maximum expected wall-clock duration for the two agents most likely to be interrupted by an API stream timeout. Use these values to decide whether an agent run is still in progress or has likely timed out.

| Agent                     | Typical run | Consider timed out if no progress after |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `item-orchestrator`       | 5–15 min    | ~25 min                                 |
| `automated-reviewer-loop` | 2–10 min    | ~20 min                                 |

These estimates assume a single development item with a normal review-fix cycle. Runs that encounter multiple fixer cycles, slow CI, or rate-limited external reviewers can exceed the typical range — escalate to human only when the maximum threshold is crossed with no visible progress.

## Resume a Timed-Out Agent Run

Long-running item-orchestrator agents can be interrupted mid-run (e.g., "API Error: Stream idle timeout" after ~20 minutes), leaving a PR in a partially-advanced state. This section explains how to detect and safely resume an interrupted run.

### Detection checklist

Inspect the PR with:

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json isDraft,labels,comments,statusCheckRollup
```

| `needs-fixes` label present                                                                                          | A prior run detected issues but the fix loop did not complete                                                                                                                                |

A PR that has readiness labels but **no reviewer loop summary comment** is the canonical sign of an interrupted run. The label alone is not a reliable completion signal.

### Resume command

```bash
# Determine the correct next step
./scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh --pr <pr_number>

# Then re-invoke the item-orchestrator (or automated-reviewer-loop agent) for the PR
# Example (Claude Code):
#   /run-item --pr <pr_number>   (or deprecated /run-item-work)
```

The item-orchestrator uses the Step 8c independent verification gate to detect any missing labels or comments and automatically re-enters the correct resume point (Step 7a, Step 7, or Step 8).

For quota exhaustion, stream timeouts, and runner failover (Cursor ↔ Codex ↔ Claude Code), see [`provider-contingency-runner-failover.md`](provider-contingency-runner-failover.md).

### Cursor `/run-item` Handoff

Cursor users should start single-item work with `/run-item <target>`. After the
bounded prelude confirms scope, guardrails, policy, and checkpoints, Cursor may
route internally through `item-orchestrator` and the configured stage subagents
(`product-manager`, `tech-lead`, `developer`, `code-reviewer`, and related
roles). This keeps role-specific model assignments active without asking users
to invoke `item-orchestrator` directly. The internal handoff must preserve the
confirmed item/policy binding and must not duplicate the bounded prelude or
re-prompt for the same policy.

### Warning

**Do NOT manually apply `ready-for-human-review` to a PR that is missing the reviewer loop summary comment.** Doing so marks the PR as ready when the automated review step was never completed, defeating the purpose of the review loop. Always resume via the item-orchestrator and let it complete Step 7 and Step 8 before the label is applied.

## Updating Model IDs Over Time

Models change frequently across providers. When your provider releases new models (or deprecates old ones), update:

- The model IDs in your agent configuration (e.g. `.claude/agents/*.md` if you use Claude Code)
- Any docs where you’ve pinned concrete model IDs (prefer keeping docs tier-based)

Guideline: keep the **tier intent** stable (economy/balanced/premium) and swap in the closest current equivalents from your provider.
