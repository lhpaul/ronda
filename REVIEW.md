# Review Contract

`REVIEW.md` is the authoritative review contract for this repository.

Use it for every pre-PR review gate and as the normalization layer for PR review tools.

- Claude Code: use the native review flow against this file.
- Codex: use the native review flow against this file.
- Cursor: use the repo review commands, which perform a manual/self-review against this file.
- Automated PR reviewers: use them after the PR is opened and pushed. They validate the PR branch; they do not replace the pre-PR review gate.

## Core Rules

### Severity

| Severity     | Meaning                                                                                                                 | Default action                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `blocking`   | Incorrect behavior, spec/plan deviation, broken workflow contract, security issue, missing critical validation or tests | Fix before PR is ready                                                   |
| `important`  | Edge-case gap, maintainability issue, unclear design choice, incomplete workflow update                                 | Fix by default unless a human decision is required                       |
| `suggestion` | Improvement that is optional and low-risk                                                                               | Fix by default; report if scope-expanding or requires a product decision |

### Haystack mirror findings

When a review references mirrored agent docs, compare the live repository surface map before treating the finding as blocking. A `Rules violation` that only points at tool-specific front matter differences or an absent `.cursor/skills` tree is advisory only; a real mismatch between mirrored workflow bodies is actionable.

### Small-finding terminal policy

A **blocking** finding on a normative document (spec, plan, protocol, `REVIEW.md`, best-practices, project docs, or the agent guidance files) is never classified as small, whatever its wording. On other non-shipped documentation paths, a finding that touches a contract surface (acceptance criteria, decision gates/matrices, fail-closed semantics, and related allow-listed phrases) is escalated to non-small; a cosmetic blocking finding may still terminate the small-findings tail. The terminal rule requires both its prior counted rounds and the round being decided to be on the current PR head. When the rule does not fire for a content or currency cause, `SMALL_FINDINGS_BLOCKED_BY` reports one of `shipped_path`, `contract_surface`, `stale_head`, or `head_unknown` (within-group precedence: `shipped_path` over `contract_surface`, `stale_head` over `head_unknown`). Full detail lives in Protocol 93's small-finding terminal policy section.

### Fix vs. Report

Fix directly when:

- The correct change is clear and low-risk
- The issue is `blocking`, `important`, or `suggestion`
- The change is mechanical: links, wording, formatting, naming, checklist completion, or deterministic script/doc updates

Report instead of fixing when:

- A product, design, or architecture decision is required
- Multiple valid fixes exist and the tradeoff is material
- The request would expand scope beyond the approved work

### Verification Discipline

- **Planted-violation proof**: any PR that adds or materially modifies an automated check, guard, lint rule, or CI job must prove — at a concrete file and line — that the check fails when the violation it targets is present, and passes once the violation is removed. Both directions are required. A check that is only described, without a demonstrated failing case, is a declared-but-unverified control and must not be trusted as evidence the check works. Pure refactors of already-proven validation logic, with no behavior change, are exempt from re-proof. See `Code Review Checklist` → Pass 2 → "PRs that add or modify an automated check, guard, lint rule, or CI job" for the enforceable checklist entry, and `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md` → "Planted-Violation Proofs" for the implementer-facing version of this rule.
- **E2E fixture contract**: any PR that adds a feature, in a repository that has a committed (non-placeholder) E2E/functional test suite, must extend the suite's seed/fixture data with the feature's edge cases in the same PR, keeping the functional suite able to reach the new states the feature introduces. The fixture's initial state must remain deterministic and versioned — rebuilding it from the same seed inputs produces a byte-identical result. This rule is not applicable in repositories without a committed E2E suite yet (including this template's own placeholder `E2E regression (placeholder)` CI job). See `Code Review Checklist` → Pass 2 → "PRs that add a feature (when a committed E2E suite exists)" for the applicability gate and enforceable checklist entry, and `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md` → "E2E Fixture Contract" for the implementer-facing version of this rule.

### PR Readiness

A PR is ready for human review only when all of the following are true:

- The relevant `REVIEW.md` checklist is satisfied
- The branch reflects any required direct fixes from the review gate
- CI is green
- Every configured automated PR reviewer is `clean` or `skipped`
- No unresolved human-requested changes remain
- For substantial or multi-part mutating item work, the branch history shows
  coherent checkpoint commits after completed logical sub-parts, or the PR notes
  why the work had no meaningful intermediate checkpoint before the final commit

If any blocking finding remains, the PR must stay out of `ready-for-human-review`.

---

## Spec Review Checklist

Read before reviewing:

- `docs/project/1-business-domain.md`
- `docs/project/3-software-architecture.md`
- The target spec

Check:

- Required spec template sections are present and no placeholders are unintentionally left behind
- Spec PRs include a current `Document Quality Gate` log in the PR description; a missing, obviously incomplete, stale, or contradictory log is an important finding by default and blocking when it claims unchecked coverage
- Spec PRs that add or modify complex workflow decision-gate behavior include a
  consistency matrix or pointer that identifies gate inputs, allowed outcomes,
  required next actions, mirror surfaces, and examples when examples are part of
  the changed surface. Missing or contradictory matrix evidence is blocking
  before `ready-for-human-review`; for non-gate documentation changes, accept a
  concise not-applicable rationale.
- Spec PRs contain only expected spec-stage artifacts. Implementation files,
  migrations, product source files, workflow scripts, or unrelated docs on a
  `spec/*` branch are a workflow-stage blocker unless a human explicitly
  escalated and accepted the exception outside the automatic readiness path.
- Use cases are explicit: actor, trigger, steps, outcome
- Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- When a tracker issue is linked, brief objectives are fully covered via a visible matrix: each objective maps to AC(s) or explicit out-of-scope deferral with rationale
- Business rules are unambiguous and non-contradictory
- Scope boundaries and out-of-scope items are explicit
- Status or enum changes include display labels and transitions
- If the spec introduces URL-serialized state (query parameters, path parameters, hash fragments), the parameter keys and all allowed values are explicitly defined — a spec that leaves parameter names or value formats unspecified forces implementers to guess the serialization contract
- The spec stays product-focused and does not over-prescribe technical design
- Terms align with the project domain and existing business rules

Typical `blocking` issues:

- Missing or ambiguous acceptance criteria
- Contradictory business rules
- Spec drift that would force engineering to guess
- URL-serialized state introduced without explicit parameter key names and allowed values
- `CHANGELOG.md` is modified in this PR — `spec/*` branches are exempt from CHANGELOG entries; remove any CHANGELOG modification before merging
- Implementation or non-stage artifacts are present on the `spec/*` PR diff

Typical `important` issues:

- Missing edge cases
- Unclear actor/trigger language
- Technical implementation detail leaking into product requirements

---

## Plan Review Checklist

Read before reviewing:

- The corresponding spec (Full Pipeline only — Refactor items have no spec; use the work item brief instead)
- The implementation plan
- Relevant code and architecture docs
- The smoke test runbook when one exists

Check:

- Every use case and acceptance criterion from the spec (or from the work item brief for Refactor items) is addressed
- Plan PRs include a current `Document Quality Gate` log in the PR description; a missing, obviously incomplete, stale, or contradictory log is an important finding by default and blocking when it claims unchecked coverage
- Plan PRs that add or modify complex workflow decision-gate behavior classify
  applicability and include matrix coverage for gate inputs, allowed outcomes,
  required next actions, mirror surfaces, and examples when examples are part of
  the changed surface. Missing rows, contradictory next actions, or unreasoned
  not-applicable entries are blocking before `ready-for-human-review`.
- Plan PRs contain only expected plan-stage artifacts: the implementation plan
  and any plan-stage smoke-test runbook. Implementation files, migrations,
  product source files, workflow scripts, or unrelated docs on an
  `implementation-plan/*` branch are a workflow-stage blocker unless a human
  explicitly escalated and accepted the exception outside the automatic
  readiness path.
- Steps are specific enough to execute without guessing
- Ordering is feasible and dependencies are explicit
- When pattern-based completeness applies, enumerated counts/paths are validated against the plan's Verification Log commands and outputs
- Parser-risk completeness (when protocol `02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` Step 3 parser-risk signals apply):
  - Edge-case enumeration is present and concrete
  - A unit test file is named with at least one automated test mapped per enumerated case
  - When suppressions are part of the proposed feature, suppression semantics explicitly define:
    - Recognized directives
    - Allowed placement
    - Interpretation of multiple suppressions on one line
- Concurrent-event-source completeness (when protocol `02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` Step 3 concurrent-event-source signals apply):
  - The plan includes a dedicated concurrency safety section
  - Each of the seven checklist items is addressed or noted as not applicable with a brief rationale: shared mutable state guards, re-entrancy / in-flight tracking, event deduplication, listener and resource cleanup, race conditions at initialization, race conditions at teardown, and error propagation across async boundaries
- Cross-cutting checklist completeness (when protocol `02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` Step 3 cross-cutting checklist signals apply):
  - The plan's "Files to modify" section explicitly enumerates all applicable targets: the developer implementation protocol, all agent/skill guidance files for tech-lead and developer roles, `REVIEW.md`, and any Codex skill files that invoke the affected stage
  - The enumeration is not limited to the primary protocol file — no required target is missing
- Cross-cutting operational assumption check:
  - Every plan includes `Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check` with either applicable evidence or a concise `Not applicable` rationale.
  - Applicable evidence records the assumption value, authoritative source,
    verification time, bounded current invocation / same-surface open PR scope,
    and result.
  - `Conflict` evidence records competing same-surface evidence, affected plan
    statements, resolution status, and decision owner; unresolved conflicts are
    blocking before implementation.
  - A not-applicable result does not perform or require a repository-wide open
    PR scan, and shared keywords alone are not treated as conflict evidence.
- Documentation updates are listed or intentionally declared unnecessary
- Seed data, generated artifacts, and follow-up tasks are called out when applicable
- The proposed approach matches existing architecture and repo patterns
- Testing and smoke-test coverage map back to acceptance criteria
- Technical accuracy (applies to all plans that reference framework/runtime behavior, guards, config, or helpers):
  - For each code sample, step-by-step instruction, or behavioral claim that references framework or runtime behavior (guards, middleware, config inheritance, scope, API contracts), identify the actual source file or authoritative reference that confirms the claim
  - Verify each such claim against the real source files — not just against other parts of the plan document
  - Flag any claim that cannot be verified from the codebase as "unverified — implementer must confirm before proceeding"
  - Cross-reference consistency: line numbers, counts, and symbolic references (e.g., smoke test counts, Verification Log output counts, log line references) must be consistent across the plan document; flag any number or reference that cannot be confirmed against the codebase or a prior plan step
- Behavioral guarantee mechanism citation: every behavioral guarantee stated in the plan (e.g., "at most once per run", "bounded", "idempotent") cites the specific mechanism that enforces it (flag, guard clause, constraint, lock, etc.); a guarantee without a cited enforcement mechanism is unverifiable and must be flagged
- Cross-section consistency: all references to the same function, constant, architecture decision, file path, directory name, or route/URL structure are consistent across all sections of the plan (e.g., a function described in the Architecture section must have the same signature in the Implementation Order steps; a constant must carry the same value everywhere it appears; a decision index must map to the same decision in every reference; a file path or route pattern defined in one section must match every other section where it appears)

Typical `blocking` issues:

- Plan steps do not cover required acceptance criteria
- The plan requires guessing at implementation details
- The plan introduces unsafe or contradictory architecture decisions
- A CHANGELOG literal in the Implementation Order uses conventional-commit format (`fix(scope): message`) instead of the project's `**Bold Title** (#N):` format
- `CHANGELOG.md` is modified in this PR — `implementation-plan/*` branches are exempt from CHANGELOG entries; remove any CHANGELOG modification before merging
- Implementation or non-stage artifacts are present on the
  `implementation-plan/*` PR diff
- A behavioral claim about framework/runtime behavior (guard logic, config inheritance, scope, API contract) cannot be verified against the codebase and is not flagged as "unverified"
- A behavioral guarantee (e.g., "at most once", "bounded", "idempotent") does not cite the specific mechanism (flag, guard clause, constraint, lock) that enforces it
- Cross-section inconsistency: the same function, constant, architecture decision, file path, directory name, or route/URL structure is defined or described differently in two or more sections of the plan (e.g., incompatible function signatures, conflicting constant values, contradictory decision rationales, a file placed under different directories in different sections, a route pattern that differs between sections)

Typical `important` issues:

- Vague wording like "update as needed"
- Missing documentation/test updates
- Incomplete dependency or rollout notes
- Verification steps in Implementation Order steps use complex shell commands that are hard to verify by reading: flag any multi-flag grep one-liner with exclusion scopes or self-referencing globs, hardcoded file counts that go stale, or broad exclusion patterns that may silently under-count. Suggest replacing with a human-readable "run and confirm output" assertion instead.
- Numeric cross-references (line numbers, counts) in the plan that cannot be confirmed against source files or Verification Log output

## Code Review Checklist

For implementation PRs (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`), this checklist is divided into two sequential passes (Pass 1 then Pass 2). Spec and plan PRs use a single-pass review and are not affected by this split.

Read before reviewing:

- The corresponding spec (Full Pipeline only — Refactor items have no spec; use the work item brief instead)
- The implementation plan
- Relevant best-practice docs
- The changed code

### Pass 1: Spec Compliance

Check:

- Implementation matches the approved spec and plan (or the plan and work item brief for Refactor items), or any deviations are documented. All acceptance criteria addressed, no out-of-scope behaviour, no missing or extra behaviours.
- CHANGELOG fragments and workflow-specific artifacts are updated when required (spec/plan-only PRs are exempt; normal feature/fix/refactor PRs add or update `changelog.d/` fragments; hotfix PRs update `CHANGELOG.md` directly with a versioned section; fixes to unreleased work update existing fragments rather than adding duplicates)
- For implementation PRs, flag stale debug comments, newly introduced `TODO`/`FIXME` markers, review-marker comments, sibling/caller inconsistencies, or uncovered spec/plan/issue-body requirements that should have been caught by the Protocol 03 Pre-Submission Self-Review Pass.
- For Full Pipeline and Refactor implementation PRs, verify the
  Pre-Submission Self-Review Pass records implementation-start re-verification
  of every applicable plan operational assumption as `Still valid`, or records
  a prior parent/human resolution for changed evidence. Implementing after
  `Stale or conflicting` evidence without a recorded resolution is blocking.

Typical `blocking` issues:

- Implementation diverges from the approved spec or plan in a way that changes observable behaviour
- Missing acceptance criteria coverage
- Stale markers, caller inconsistencies, or uncovered spec/plan/issue-body requirements remain in the PR after the pre-submission pass
- Missing implementation-start operational-assumption re-verification for a
  plan-backed implementation whose plan recorded applicable assumptions
- Changelog fragment or hotfix CHANGELOG entry absent when required, or present when exempt (spec/plan PRs)

### Pass 2: Code Quality

Check:

- Project and stack conventions are followed
- Logic and edge cases are correct
- Security boundaries and validation are respected
- Tests cover the changed business behavior
- New patterns are justified and consistent with the codebase

Additional checks for **documentation PRs** (when a PR adds or modifies documentation files — `*.md`, `*.yaml`, `*.toml` config docs, or any prose-only file):

- **Intra-file content duplication**: when a new section is added to an existing file, verify that any tables or lists in the new section are not reproducing content already present elsewhere in the same file. If a duplicate is found, flag it as `important` with a recommendation to cross-reference the canonical location instead of duplicating.
- **Wording consistency**: verify that procedural instructions in a new section (e.g., "push a commit", "apply a label", "run a script") are consistent with the existing flow described in sibling sections of the same file. Flag contradictions as `important`.
- **Shell snippet safety in protocol files**: when a PR adds or modifies shell code blocks (`` ```bash `` / `` ```sh `` fenced blocks) inside a protocol or documentation `.md` file, apply the same quality bar as for `.sh` files (see the "Shell Script Quality Checklist" in `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md`). Specifically flag as `important` any multi-command state-mutating block that lacks `set -euo pipefail`, any block that commits or pushes without a wrong-branch guard, and any single-liner that can fail silently without an explicit `|| exit 1` or equivalent error guard. Changed executable framework snippets also require an adjacent `workflow-shell-contract` marker; flag missing explicit Bash launchers, implicit portable splitting, Bash-only portable syntax, and Bash 4+ examples. Read-only query snippets (e.g., `gh pr view`, `git log`) are exempt.
- **Residual evidence for sweep/batch work**: when an implementation PR can
  reach `ready-for-human-review` for sweep, batch, helper-extraction,
  numeric-target, or pattern-completeness work, verify that residual evidence is
  present and that remaining residuals are completed, explicitly out of scope, or
  linked to follow-up issues. Silent prose deferral is an important finding, and
  missing evidence that allows readiness is blocking.
- **Complex workflow decision-gate matrix**: when an implementation PR adds or
  modifies workflow decision-gate behavior with multiple inputs, outcomes,
  next-action branches, status labels, exit states, examples, or mirrored
  workflow surfaces, verify that the PR evidence includes a consistency matrix
  or pointer with gate inputs, allowed outcomes, required next actions, mirror
  surfaces, and examples when examples are part of the changed surface. Missing
  rows, contradictory wording between mirror surfaces, or unreasoned
  not-applicable entries are blocking before `ready-for-human-review`.

Additional checks for **PRs that add or modify guardrails enforcement behavior** (orchestration protocols, agent files, skill files, or guardrails-related documentation):

- **Named-stop contract**: every stop message emitted by the changed code or documented behavior names (a) the exact stop condition string from `docs/workflow/development-workflow/guardrails-enforcement.md` section 4, (b) the affected work item, and (c) the concrete human action to unblock. Missing any of the three elements is a `blocking` finding.
- **Single run-epic policy path**: verify the changed code or documentation does not introduce a second policy model separate from the run-epic helpers (`run-epic-risk-classifier.sh`, `run-epic-delegated-gate.sh`, `run-epic-audit-trail.sh`). Adding a parallel enforcement path is a `blocking` finding.
- **Five enforcement gates present**: confirm the PR accounts for all six gates from `guardrails-enforcement.md` section 3 (load+report, backlog-start, PR-open, delegated review, delegated merge, and completion) and does not leave any gate unimplemented or bypassed.
- **Delegated merge/review/backlog-start/completion gates**: confirm the orchestration path (Protocol 90, 91, or 95) enforces each of these gates before the relevant decision point (opening a PR, making a review decision, merging, marking complete), not after.
- **Audit recording**: when `audit.pr_disposition_record` or `audit.work_item_ledger_record` is required, confirm the stable audit markers (`<!-- run-epic:pr-disposition -->` and `<!-- run-epic:epic-ledger -->`) are used so reruns update rather than duplicate records.
- **Conservative defaults declared**: the load+report step must state "conservative defaults in effect" when no `guardrails` section is present, and must enumerate each default value (mode=`manual`, `may_merge_pr: false`, `max_merge_risk: low`, backlog starts confirmation-gated, no audit requirements).
- **Security-advisory carve-out (BR5)**: confirm the changed code or documented behavior never lets a delegated agent record `human-accepted` / `human-rejected` for a security-sensitive advisory finding — only a fixed commit or a verified human decision resolves it.

Additional checks for **PRs that add or modify branch creation, PR creation, or nested/stage-agent dispatch behavior**:

- **Nested artifact guard present**: confirm item-scoped branch and PR creation paths call `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh` with the parent-approved `--approved-base` before mutation. Missing base context, duplicate artifacts, wrong-base PRs, and scan failures must block instead of falling back to the GitHub default branch.
- **Mutating batch dispatch isolation present**: when the PR adds or modifies
  Work Item Runner batch dispatch behavior, confirm Protocol 90 requires a
  pre-dispatch isolation manifest with item identifier, expected branch,
  absolute worktree path, `isolation: "worktree"`, mutation classification,
  artifact repo root, and base branch for every mutating runner, including
  sequential fallback. Missing-isolation and duplicate-worktree cases must stop
  before dispatch.
- **Runner pre-mutation self-check present**: when the PR adds or modifies
  worktree-isolated runner, item-orchestrator, developer, or fixer-agent
  handoffs, confirm the runner checks expected worktree path and expected branch
  against `pwd -P` and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` before the first file
  edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation, tracker mutation, or
  stage-agent handoff. Wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, and wrong branch must stop
  before mutation; possible prior out-of-worktree mutation must escalate for
  human inspection instead of auto-repair.
- **Isolation is distinct from #1200 artifact guarding**: confirm the PR does
  not rely on the duplicate/wrong-base nested artifact guard alone as evidence
  of worktree isolation. #1200 prevents unsanctioned duplicate PR artifacts;
  concurrent worktree isolation prevents sanctioned mutating runners from
  sharing one checkout or mutating the main tree.
- **Issue matching boundaries tested**: confirm tests cover numeric boundary cases, tracker-prefixed branches, lookalike paths, local/remote/worktree artifacts, open PRs, and any new workflow branch prefix introduced by the PR.
- **Parent-visible disposition**: confirm duplicate-fork, wrong-base, scan-failure, and explicit-split results are visible in the parent runner summary or PR evidence before the item can be marked ready.

Additional checks for **PRs that add or modify Work Item Runner completion,
batch terminal reporting, or final-report examples**:

- **Ground-truth completion verification required**: confirm Protocol 91, Protocol
  90, mirrored item-orchestrator/orchestrator guidance, and command aliases
  require the `## Ground-Truth Completion Verification` section from
  `item-completion-self-check.sh` before any item is reported ready, done,
  blocked, escalated, waiting on a human, waiting on merge, or cleanup complete.
  Missing coverage in any runner path is an `important` finding; missing tests
  for the helper or changed report behavior is `blocking`.
- **No unsupported terminal examples**: final-report examples must not claim
  readiness, completion, blocked, escalated, or waiting-on-human states without a
  ground-truth evidence section or an explicit not-applicable rationale. Treat
  unsupported examples as `important` because downstream agents copy them.

Additional checks for **PRs that add new filter parameters to a tool schema** (Zod, JSON Schema, Joi, Pydantic, OpenAPI, or any equivalent contract-declaration mechanism):

- **Filter-wiring verification**: confirm the new filter is wired to the query builder's WHERE clause or equivalent filter-application function — not only declared in the schema.
- **Canary test presence** (blocking): confirm a canary test is present that calls the tool with the new filter set to a value that narrows results, calls the tool again without the filter (or with a meaningfully different value), and asserts the two result sets differ. A canary test that produces identical results for both invocations does not satisfy this requirement.
- **Same-PR inclusion** (blocking): confirm the canary test is part of this PR, not deferred to a follow-up.
- **Exemption**: this check applies to new filter parameters only. Modifications to existing filter parameters that do not change the schema contract are exempt.

Additional checks for **PRs that add or modify an automated check, guard, lint rule, or CI job** (any change that introduces or strengthens an automated validation gate):

- **Planted-violation proof presence** (blocking): confirm the PR evidence includes, for each new or materially modified check, a demonstrated run at a concrete file and line showing (a) the check fails when the targeted violation is present at that location, and (b) the check passes once the violation is removed. A description of intended behavior without both demonstrated runs does not satisfy this requirement.
- **Location specificity** (blocking): confirm the cited location is an actual file path and line number (or an equivalent addressable location for non-file checks, e.g. a specific command invocation or config key) — not a paraphrase or hypothetical example.
- **Same-PR inclusion** (blocking): confirm the proof is part of this PR's evidence, not deferred to a follow-up PR or assumed from a prior similar change.
- **Exemption**: pure refactors of already-proven validation logic, with no behavior change, are exempt from re-proof; the PR evidence should state the exemption rationale.

Additional checks for **PRs that add or modify user-facing copy in a
project with a configured i18n / catalogue convention** (see
[`docs/best-practices/stack/i18n.md`](docs/best-practices/stack/i18n.md)):

- **Applicability gate**: this check applies only to a downstream project that has adopted an i18n / catalogue convention for user-facing copy. When a project has not adopted this convention, this check is not applicable; do not treat it as a blanket requirement for every PR in every repository.
- **Enforcement is active** (blocking when applicable): confirm the project's no-hardcoded-string enforcement mechanism (a lint rule or equivalent machine check) is configured and currently enabled, not merely documented as a convention.
- **Catalogue parity** (blocking when applicable): confirm every catalogue/locale file the project ships is updated together in this PR — no locale is left with a missing or stale key that another locale added.
- **Planted-violation proof for enforcement changes**: when this PR adds or materially modifies the enforcement mechanism itself (the lint rule config, a custom key-extraction scanner, or equivalent), apply the "PRs that add or modify an automated check, guard, lint rule, or CI job" block above in full, including explicit coverage of any dynamic/non-literal key argument form the scanner is meant to reject — this block does not restate that requirement, it delegates to it.

Additional checks for **PRs that add a feature (when a committed E2E suite exists)**:

- **Applicability gate**: this check applies only when the repository has a committed, non-placeholder E2E/functional suite (i.e., `docs/testing/README.md` Section 2's "committed automated spec" path is filled in, and the repo's E2E CI job runs real tests rather than this template's placeholder). When no such suite exists yet, this check is not applicable; record the not-applicable rationale rather than silently skipping it.
- **Fixture/seed extension** (blocking when applicable): confirm the PR extends the suite's seed/fixture data with the new feature's edge cases in the same PR, so the functional suite can reach the new states the feature introduces.
- **Deterministic, versioned initial state** (blocking when applicable): confirm the seed/fixture rebuild is deterministic — the same seed inputs produce a byte-identical initial state — and that the fixture change ships in the same PR as the code change it supports, not as a manually applied, undocumented data edit.
- **Silent deferral is a finding**: a feature PR that skips fixture extension without invoking the applicability gate above is an `important` finding by default, and `blocking` if the feature's new states are otherwise unreachable by the functional suite.

Additional checks for **shell scripts** (`*.sh`):

- Option parsing validates that required values are present before `shift`
- All error paths emit structured output consistent with the script's output contract
- User-supplied input (PR numbers, branch names) is validated before interpolation into file paths or commands
- `|| true` does not silently swallow failures from external commands (e.g., `gh`, `git`) that the caller needs to know about
- Workflow shell PRs run `python3 scripts/lint/workflow-shell-guard-lint.py --base-ref origin/develop` in addition to ShellCheck; missing guard execution is an important finding

Additional checks for **database migrations** (when a migration adds or changes triggers, functions, or backfills):

- **Trigger/backfill arithmetic parity**: If both a trigger and a backfill compute the same derived value, they must use the **same formula**, including guards such as `GREATEST`, `LEAST`, `COALESCE`, and null handling. A trigger that differs from its backfill is a latent production bug.

Additional checks for **features with concurrent event sources** (when the PR introduces or modifies code where multiple execution contexts — listeners, timers, callbacks, async queues — can access shared mutable state):

- **Shared mutable state guards**: shared state is protected from concurrent reads/writes by a consistent access pattern (e.g., serialized queue, ownership transfer, copy-on-update)
- **Re-entrancy / in-flight tracking**: the handler correctly tracks or rejects concurrent in-flight operations when a second event can arrive before the first completes
- **Event deduplication**: duplicate logical events (e.g., reconnect triggers, repeated callbacks) are deduplicated or idempotent
- **Listener and resource cleanup**: all registered listeners, timers, and handles are removed at teardown; in-flight operations are drained or discarded safely
- **Race conditions at initialization**: events that arrive before initialization completes are handled correctly (queued, dropped, or deferred with correct sequencing)
- **Race conditions at teardown**: events that arrive after teardown begins are discarded or drained without causing errors or accessing freed state
- **Error propagation across async boundaries**: errors from async callbacks are surfaced to the caller; unhandled rejections or uncaught exceptions in callbacks do not silently swallow failures

Typical `blocking` issues:

- Incorrect behavior
- Security flaw
- Broken build/test path
- Missing critical test coverage for changed business logic

Typical `important` issues:

- Important edge cases missed
- Unnecessary complexity
- Inconsistent architecture or unclear code structure

## Workflow Policy Review Checklist

For changes to the documents and scripts that define how the workflow itself
behaves — `REVIEW.md`, the root agent instruction files, `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`,
`docs/workflow/**`, `docs/best-practices/**`, `scripts/development-workflow/**`,
and the per-tool instruction trees `.claude/**`, `.cursor/**`, `.codex/**`, and
`.agents/**` — apply this checklist in addition to the stage checklist the
branch implies.

1. Does every stated count match what the document actually contains, by
   extraction rather than by reading?
2. Does every gate name its inputs, its decision for each combination of
   them, and its behavior when an input is missing or malformed?
3. Does a rule asserted as fail-closed have a path that reaches the
   permissive branch — an allow-list stated as a deny-list, an empty set
   treated as satisfied, an absent value treated as a match?
4. Does every new or modified check carry a planted-violation proof at a
   concrete file and line, and can the plant actually change the check's
   answer? A proof whose plant is masked by an earlier rule is not a
   proof.
5. Does the change alter a `key=value` contract, a JSON schema version, or
   a stdout surface another script parses, and if so is every consumer
   named?
6. Do the protocol document, the integration document and the `--help`
   output describe the same behavior as the code?
7. Does every catalogue entry read generally — no person's name, no document
   title, no wording that only makes sense to someone who saw the original
   incident?

## Tool Guidance

### Claude Code

- Prefer Claude Code's native review capability for the pre-PR review gate.
- Use the checklist in this file as the review rubric.
- If a repo compatibility protocol is explicitly requested, use the corresponding wrapper protocol under `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/`.

### Codex

- Prefer Codex native review/code-review capability for the pre-PR review gate.
- Use the checklist in this file as the review rubric.
- If a repo compatibility protocol is explicitly requested, use the corresponding wrapper protocol under `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/`.

### Cursor

- Use the repo commands `/review-spec`, `/review-implementation-plan`, and `/review-code`.
- Those commands should manually review against this file and apply direct fixes when appropriate.

### CodeRabbit CLI

- Use the CodeRabbit CLI as an optional pre-push review tool for local changes.
- In Claude Code: `/coderabbit:review`. Standalone: `cr` or `cr --agent`.
- CodeRabbit CLI findings complement the pre-PR review gate but do not replace it.
- When `coderabbit-cli` is configured as a Step 7 platform, require script
  evidence from `pr-review-loop.sh`: `RESULT=clean` is fresh review evidence;
  `RESULT=skipped` with unavailable, auth, timeout, invalid-output, or
  rate-limit reasons is only availability evidence.
- See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/coderabbit.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/coderabbit.md) for setup and usage modes.

### Automated PR Reviewers

- Treat automated PR reviewers as post-push validation.
- Default aggregation policy is sequential: run configured reviewers in order and do not continue to the next reviewer until the current one is `clean` or `skipped`.
- Any blocking finding from any configured reviewer keeps the PR out of `ready-for-human-review`.
- Suggestions remain non-blocking unless they are restated as a blocking review decision.
