name: batch-merge
description: Merge all ready PRs in a parallel batch into the target base branch sequentially, auto-resolving legacy trivial CHANGELOG and documentation conflicts, pausing for human input only on non-trivial conflicts, and running post-merge-cleanup for each successfully merged PR. Prints the merge plan for visibility but proceeds immediately without requiring confirmation. Use when a parallel batch of PRs is ready for merge.

# Batch Merge

Follow `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/94-batch-merge-protocol.md` exactly.

1. **Auto-discovery mode** (no explicit PR numbers): run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh discover
   ```

   If `DISCOVERY_RESULT=none`, exit immediately with an informational message — no merges occur.

2. **Explicit PR list** (PR numbers provided by the human): run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh discover --prs <num1,num2,...>
   ```

3. Display the candidate summary table (PR number, title, branch, labels, readiness status).

4. **Readiness gate**: for each PR missing `ready-for-human-review`, warn the human and require an explicit include-or-skip decision. Never silently include or skip.

5. **Merge plan display**: present the final ordered merge plan, then proceed immediately without waiting for user confirmation.

6. **Sequential merge loop**: for each PR in order:
   - Run `./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh merge --pr <number> --expected-head-sha <reviewed-headRefOid>` using the head SHA captured by the latest readiness/review gate.
   - On `MERGE_RESULT=clean`: proceed to post-merge steps.
   - On `MERGE_RESULT=conflict`: classify each conflicted file:
     - `CHANGELOG.md`: legacy fallback only; auto-resolve by combining all `[Unreleased]` entries (HEAD side first, incoming side second, no entries dropped). Report what was combined.
     - Documentation files (`docs/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`): auto-resolve if non-overlapping; escalate if overlapping.
     - All other files (or overlapping doc changes): pause, show conflict markers, wait for human to resolve or abort.
   - On `MERGE_RESULT=failed`: report the error, mark `failed`, continue.
   - After each successful merge: complete the post-merge sequence from Protocol 94 Step 4.2 (the merge helper already pushed the target base branch and called `gh pr merge`; verify GitHub shows `MERGED`, delete the remote branch if it still exists, create a temporary local branch if needed, then run `./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh --base <target-base> --pr <number> <branch>`).
   - Before selecting the next PR, run `./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh recheck-remaining --prs <comma-separated-approved-pr-list> --after-merged-pr <number> --base <target-base> --approved-unready-prs <comma-separated-human-included-unready-prs>` for the frozen in-scope PR list. Apply Protocol 94 Step 4.2 as the source of truth for post-recheck admission semantics.

7. **Final summary**: always print a table listing every candidate PR with its outcome code (`merged_clean`, `merged_auto`, `merged_human`, `skipped_not_ready`, `skipped_conflict`, `merge_blocked`, `out_of_scope`, `failed`, `not_attempted`).

Key rules:

- Never leave the target base branch in a conflicted state — always run `git merge --abort` if a conflict cannot be resolved.
- Do not force-push or rebase PR branches.
- Do not use `gh pr close` — the merge must be recognized by GitHub as `MERGED`.
- Already-merged PRs stay merged even if the human aborts mid-batch.
- `git push origin develop` failures are **batch-fatal**: stop processing further PRs immediately, run `git merge --abort` if a conflict exists, surface a clear error, and require human intervention before resuming.
- `post-merge-cleanup` failures are reported but do not stop remaining merges.
