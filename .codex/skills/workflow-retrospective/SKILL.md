description: Run a retrospective analysis on completed work to identify process improvement opportunities. Use when the user wants to review a completed batch or item run, or invoke on-demand with a PR number, branch, or date as scope hint.

# Workflow Retrospective

Recommended model tier: `balanced`

**Meta-Retrospective**: If the user invokes this skill with a meta scope (e.g., "run meta-retro", "periodic verification", or similar phrasing indicating trend analysis of prior improvements), follow `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06b-meta-retrospective-protocol.md` instead of the regular retrospective flow below. The meta-retrospective includes a platform evaluation step (Step 2b) that reads `docs/workflow/retro-metrics-platforms.md` and reports the running exclusive-block rate for each review platform against the graduation criteria. When fewer than 30 compare-mode runs are logged, Step 2b explicitly states data is insufficient for a graduation decision.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide rules.
2. Read `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/06-retrospective-protocol.md`.
3. Resolve scope from the user's request (PR number, branch name, batch date) or default to recent PRs in the repository.
4. Gather GitHub PR metadata (review cycles, finding types, labels, merge conflicts) and git history (commit patterns, fix-commit ratio) using `gh`. When conversation context is available, also analyze manual interventions, human corrections, and agent deviations from the current session.
5. Synthesize findings into a categorized list using the fixed taxonomy and severity signals defined in the protocol.
6. After synthesizing findings, populate the required metrics block (see Step 3d
   in the protocol): batch identifier, human interventions count, Step 5.2
   violations count, automated-reviewer retry loops count, escalations count,
   prior action item recurrence assessment. For automated-reviewer retry loops,
   parse `reviewer_loop_history.v1` from the latest script-owned reviewer-loop
   summary comment first and calculate `max(entries.length - 1, 0)` when
   `history_status` is `available`; otherwise record `unavailable (<reason>)`
   before falling back to legacy timestamp heuristics. Record `unavailable` for
   any field that cannot be reliably determined.
7. Present findings to the human, including the metrics block alongside improvement opportunities. For each opportunity, accept the human's choice of "Address now", "Add to backlog", or "Skip" — then execute the chosen action.
8. "Address now": apply simple fix on a `fix/[slug]` branch, open a PR to `develop`, and proceed through normal review/CI gates — do not push directly to shared branches. "Add to backlog": create GitHub issue directly via `gh issue create`. "Skip": move on.
9. After all opportunities are acted on, append the finalized metrics block to `docs/workflow/retro-metrics.md` as a new table row.
10. Post a confirmation summary table.
