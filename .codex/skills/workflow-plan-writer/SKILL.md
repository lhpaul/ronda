description: Write an implementation plan for a feature (after spec approval) or a refactor (plan only, no spec). Use when a work item needs to advance into the implementation plan stage.

# Workflow Plan Writer

Recommended model tier: `premium`

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide rules and branch overrides.
2. Read `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md`.
3. Follow that protocol exactly.
4. Use the plan to make technical decisions that the spec intentionally avoids. For Refactor items, use the work item brief instead of a spec.
5. When `BATCH_CONTEXT=true`, complete the isolation self-check before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation, or tracker mutation: verify `isolation: "worktree"`, expected worktree path, expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/` and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch; escalate if mutation may already have occurred outside the assigned worktree.
6. For substantial or multi-part mutating plan work, commit immediately after
   each completed logical sub-part, do not intentionally batch all completed
   sub-parts into one end-of-run commit, and never commit incomplete, failing,
   or incoherent edits only to satisfy the requirement.
7. Use follow-up commits for published plan PR branches. If a destructive
   branch update would be required, stop before mutation and route the exact
   push through `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-branch-push-guard.sh`.
   In `workflow_hub`, resolve the helper from `WORKFLOW_TOOL_ROOT` and pass the
   pushed checkout as `--repo-root "$ARTIFACT_REPO_ROOT"`.
8. Before any other planning work, run the Step 0 Template-Fit Check: read `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml` and if `template.is_template` is `true`, evaluate whether the spec is generic enough for a framework template. If the spec references a framework-specific language or runtime not used by the template's own toolchain (e.g., React, Rails, Django), surface the structured warning from Step 0 and halt until the human responds. Do not write any plan content while this check is pending.
8. When the spec implies pattern-based completeness, run a live repo query, record a Verification Log, and only use frozen enumerations when explicitly authorized in the spec.
9. For sweep, batch, helper-extraction, numeric-target, or pattern-completeness
   plans, name the residual verification strategy and evidence source
   implementation must produce before readiness.
10. Before finalizing Step 3, classify parser-risk using the deterministic signals in protocol 02 (tooling-path parser/lint changes, parser/scanner-oriented module naming, or explicit regex/structured-text scanning behavior). When parser-risk applies, include the mandatory edge-case enumeration and unit-test mapping subsections before deep Layer-by-Layer walkthroughs. If suppressions are part of the feature, include suppression semantics (recognized directives, placement, and multi-suppression behavior).
11. Before finalizing Step 3, also classify concurrent-event-source using the deterministic signals in protocol 02 (two or more concurrent event listeners/socket callbacks/timers/async queues, shared mutable state across execution contexts, or initialization/teardown sequences that race with incoming events). When concurrent-event-source applies, include the mandatory concurrency safety checklist section with design decisions for each of the seven items.
12. Before finalizing Step 3, also check whether the plan introduces or modifies a cross-cutting checklist (a safety, quality, or compliance category that applies across multiple feature implementations). When cross-cutting checklist applies, enumerate ALL files that need updating — including the developer protocol, all agent/skill guidance files, `REVIEW.md`, and any Codex skill files that invoke the affected stage. Run the live search defined in protocol 02's "Cross-cutting checklist plans" block before writing the enumeration.
13. Every plan must include Protocol 02's
    `Cross-Cutting Operational Assumption Check`. Record applicable
    operational facts with value, source, verification
    time, bounded current invocation / same-surface open PR scope, and result; otherwise record
    `Not applicable` with a concise rationale and do not scan every open PR.
    Return same-surface `Conflict` evidence to the parent orchestrator for
    `Resolved` or `Human decision required` handling, and stop plan-stage
    advancement until that resolution or decision is recorded.
14. Before opening the draft plan PR, complete Protocol 02's Document Quality
    Gate and include the gate log in the PR description. For complex workflow
    decision-gate plans, include Protocol 02's matrix classification and
    Document Quality Gate entry.
15. Before opening the draft plan PR, call `ensure_on_project_board <issue_number> "Writing Plan"` from `scripts/development-workflow/workflow-lib.sh`. This is a no-op when the issue is already on the board.
16. Before creating the plan branch or opening the plan PR for a tracker-backed item, run `run-nested-artifact-guard.sh` with required `--mode`, `--issue`, `--expected-branch`, `--approved-base`, plus the expected `implementation-plan/*` branch and approved artifact base. Stop on missing base, duplicate artifacts, wrong-base PRs, or scan failures.
17. Keep implementation files off `implementation-plan/*` branches. Before plan PR readiness, Protocol 91 Step 8a must run `check-documentation-stage-alignment.sh`; a mismatch must be corrected or escalated before `ready-for-human-review`.
18. Before writing or updating the smoke runbook, discover design assets per
    `docs/workflow/development-workflow/design-assets.md`. When assets exist,
    include at least one expected-vs-actual fidelity step; when none exist, omit
    fidelity steps and do not invent a baseline.
19. When the branch is created, continue through reviewer gate, PR creation, and PR readiness unless the protocol surfaces a real human decision.
20. Resolve repository mode, artifact owner, and artifact base branch before
    writing: `single_repo` uses the current repository; `workflow_hub` keeps
    plans and plan PRs hub-owned on the hub artifact base branch, even when the
    product implementation base is different; `product_repo` should report the
    configured hub owner or stop if ownership is ambiguous.
