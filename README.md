# AI Dev Framework Template

A tool-agnostic framework for AI-assisted software development. It structures the entire development lifecycle — from idea to production — with canonical protocols that any AI coding assistant can follow: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, or any other tool.

## What This Is

This template provides:

- **A staged development workflow** (Spec → Plan → Implement → Review → Release) with persistent orchestration until PRs are actually clean
- **Canonical protocol documents** that AI agents execute — one per workflow stage
- **Thin tool wrappers** for Claude Code (`.claude/agents/`), Cursor (`.cursor/agents/`, `.cursor/commands/`), and Codex (`.codex/skills/`) that point to those protocols
- **A guided project setup** so any AI assistant can help you fill in the project-specific docs

The key principle: **protocols live in `docs/`** and are tool-agnostic. Tool-specific configs (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`) are thin wrappers that reference those protocols. Add support for a new AI tool by creating a thin wrapper — no protocol duplication needed.

---

## Getting Started: Project Setup

When you first clone this template into a new project, first choose the
repository mode, then run the **Project Setup** workflow to generate your
project-specific documentation.

### Choose A Repository Mode

Use `single_repo` when one repository owns the tracker item, specs, plans,
implementation branches, PRs, CI, reviewer-loop checks, and releases. This is
the default path and uses the current repository root exactly as before.
Repositories with no mode declaration are treated as `single_repo`.

Use `workflow_hub` when one repository coordinates workflow for multiple product
repositories. Inspect `template/workflow-hub/` for the hub-owned skeleton:
workflow protocols, scripts, agent wrappers, workflow configuration, and
hub-owned runbooks.

Use `product_repo` when a product repository receives implementation work routed
from a workflow hub. Inspect `template/product-repo-injection/` for the minimal
injection skeleton. Product repositories should not receive hub-owned tracker
state, historical specs, implementation plans, or hub-only smoke runbooks unless
a later workflow explicitly marks a specific artifact as required.

Generated repositories should select the mode before setup writes
`.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`. Existing repositories should choose the closest current
role: keep `single_repo` for the current all-in-one workflow, adopt
`workflow_hub` when centralizing portfolio workflow, or adopt `product_repo`
when connecting product code validation to a separate hub.

See
[`docs/workflow/development-workflow/repository-modes.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/repository-modes.md)
for the artifact ownership model and
[`sync-manifest.yaml`](sync-manifest.yaml) for the informational sync-scope
metadata used by the skeletons.

### With Claude Code

```
Use the project-setup agent: Task the agent with "Initialize this project using the setup protocol"
```

### With Cursor

```
/setup-project
```

### With any other AI tool

Ask your AI assistant to:

```
Follow the project setup protocol at docs/workflow/setup/protocol.md
```

The setup agent will have a structured conversation with you to understand your project, then generate:

- `docs/project/1-business-domain.md` — Domain model, entities, business rules
- `docs/project/2-repo-architecture.md` — Monorepo/repository structure
- `docs/project/3-software-architecture.md` — Tech stack, design patterns, architectural decisions
- `docs/project/4-database-model.md` — Data model (if applicable)
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` — Best practices tailored to your stack
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with your project context

## The Development Workflow

```
Backlog

**Special paths:**

- **Refactor** (`refactor/[slug]` from develop): code restructuring or tech-debt cleanup with a plan but no spec
- **Fast Track** (`fix/[slug]` from develop): bugs and simple changes that don't need a spec or plan
- **Hotfix** (`hotfix/[slug]` from main): critical production bugs that need immediate deployment

See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md) for the full workflow specification.

For teams coordinating work across more than one repository, see
[`docs/workflow/development-workflow/repository-modes.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/repository-modes.md)
for the supported repository modes, artifact ownership rules, and PR ownership
model. Repositories with no mode declaration continue to behave as
single-repository adopters. The inspectable skeletons live at
`template/workflow-hub/` and `template/product-repo-injection/`.

## Using With Different AI Tools

### Claude Code

- Agents are defined in `.claude/agents/`
- `CLAUDE.md` (symlink to `AGENTS.md`) is auto-loaded
- Invoke agents via the Task tool or by mentioning the agent name

Example prompts:

```text
Use the orchestrator agent to inspect this repository's AI development workflow state, determine what work can safely advance next, and keep advancing each eligible item until it reaches a real terminal condition. Follow AGENTS.md and the workflow protocols exactly. If multiple items are eligible, prioritize by the documented rules and explain any blockers or escalations.
```

```text
Use the orchestrator agent to review the current backlog, specs, plans, branches, and open PRs in this repository. Advance deterministic in-flight work, and when Backlog work is next, propose the largest safe start batch by priority and parallelization feasibility before asking for approval. Minimize human interaction, but stop for human decisions, merge review, blocked dependencies, or escalations.
```

```text
Use the item-orchestrator agent to start and advance work for [feature or issue name]. Resolve the request to one workflow item, then keep progressing that item through creator, reviewer, PR, automated review, and CI until it is waiting on a human, blocked, or escalated.
```

### Cursor

- Rules in `.cursor/rules/` provide automatic context (files in `.cursor/rules/` use `.mdc` extension)
- Commands in `.cursor/commands/` are invoked with `/command-name`
- Workflow agents (subagents) in `.cursor/agents/` are invoked with `/agent-name` (e.g. `/developer`, `/orchestrator`, `/item-orchestrator`); see `docs/workflow/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md` for model config
- MCP servers can be configured in `.cursor/.mcp.json`
- No `.cursor/skills/` mirror is shipped: Cursor discovers the existing agent, command, and shared `.agents/skills/` surfaces directly, and review tooling treats an absent Cursor skills tree as intentional rather than a missing mirror

Example commands:

```text
/run-work
```

```text
/run-work Review the current backlog, specs, plans, branches, and open PRs in this repository. Advance deterministic in-flight work, and when Backlog work is next, propose the largest safe start batch by priority and parallelization feasibility before asking for approval. Minimize human interaction, but stop for human decisions, merge review, blocked dependencies, or escalations.
```

```text
/run-work Start and advance work for [feature or issue name]. Inspect the current workflow state first, then keep progressing that item through creator, reviewer, PR, automated review, and CI until it is waiting on a human, blocked, or escalated.
```

```text
/run-item-work Start and advance work for [feature or issue name]. Resolve the request to one workflow item, then keep progressing that item through creator, reviewer, PR, automated review, and CI until it is waiting on a human, blocked, or escalated.
```

> **Note**: `/run-work` is the primary adaptive entrypoint. It runs the routing
> classifier and routes to portfolio scan, single-item, or epic protocols based
> on your target. `/run-item-work` and `/run-epic` are compatibility/advanced
> aliases that bypass routing for direct access.
> In no-target scan mode, `/run-work` is read-only and separates
> `INFORMATIONAL - not actionable in this proposal`,
> `ACTIONABLE RESUME - can advance now`,
> `PROPOSED BATCH - your decision`, and
> `HELD - not included in proposed batch` records. Approval or the recommended
> `/run-items` command applies only to the proposed-batch records.

### Codex

- Install the bundled skills with `./scripts/development-workflow/install-codex-skills.sh`
- Start with `/run-work` (or `$run-work` / `$workflow-orchestrator`) as the primary adaptive entrypoint; it routes to portfolio scan, single-item, or epic based on the supplied target
- Run `/run-work` on an `economy` tier by default; only escalate when the stage-specific skill recommends it
- Use `/run-item-work` (or `$workflow-item-orchestrator`) when you want to resume or advance one specific development, branch, or PR directly without routing
- Use the other skills in `.codex/skills/` when you want to run a specific stage directly
- The skills are thin wrappers around the same protocol docs used by the other tools
- Each skill can also ship `agents/openai.yaml` metadata for cleaner labels and starter prompts in Codex-compatible UIs

Example prompts:

```text
Use $workflow-orchestrator to inspect this repository's AI development workflow state, determine what work can safely advance next, and keep advancing each eligible item until it reaches a real terminal condition. Follow AGENTS.md and the workflow protocols exactly. If multiple items are eligible, prioritize by the documented rules and explain any blockers or escalations.
```

```text
Use $workflow-orchestrator to review the current backlog, specs, plans, branches, and open PRs in this repository. Advance deterministic in-flight work, and when Backlog work is next, propose the largest safe start batch by priority and parallelization feasibility before asking for approval. Minimize human interaction, but stop for human decisions, merge review, blocked dependencies, or escalations.
```

```text
Use $workflow-item-orchestrator to start and advance work for [feature or issue name]. Resolve the request to one workflow item, then keep progressing that item through creator, reviewer, PR, automated review, and CI until it is waiting on a human, blocked, or escalated.
```

### Other AI Tools (Gemini CLI, etc.)

- Point your tool at `AGENTS.md` for project context
- Ask it to follow protocols in `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/`
- The protocols are plain markdown — any AI can follow them

---

## Optional Integrations

- **Issue Tracker (e.g., Linear)**: See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md)
- **Automated PR Review (e.g., CodeRabbit, claude-code-action)**: See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/coderabbit.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/coderabbit.md) or [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/greptile.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/greptile.md). For projects that want to avoid per-hour rate-limit stalls, `claude-code-action` is the recommended `phase_after_clean` value (no review cap; uses your own Anthropic API key). See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/claude-code-action.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/claude-code-action.md) for setup instructions (added by sibling item #707).
- **GitHub Projects board**: See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/github-projects.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/github-projects.md)
- **CI/CD deployment placeholders**: See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/ci-cd-deployment.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/ci-cd-deployment.md)

---

## Mandatory Conventions

- **CHANGELOG.md is required**: follow the canonical CHANGELOG policy in [`docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md#changelog`](docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md#changelog), including parallel-batch handling.
- **Human merge gates**: PRs for spec, plan, and implementation are opened by agents and kept moving until they are actually review-ready; humans still review and merge them.
- **No destructive Git operations** without explicit human approval (no `--force`, `reset --hard`, `rebase` on shared branches).

---

## Managing This Template Alongside Your Projects

### Recommended local setup

```
~/Git/
├── ai-dev-framework-template/   ← this repo (upstream)
├── project-a/                   ← downstream: has its own copy of framework files
├── project-b/                   ← downstream: has its own copy of framework files
└── ...
```

Each project created from this template carries its own copy of the framework files. This keeps projects fully self-contained — every team member, CI/CD system, and AI agent has access to the docs without external dependencies.

### Starting a new project

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create a new repository
2. Clone it locally
3. Run the setup agent to generate project-specific docs (see [Getting Started](#getting-started-project-setup))

### Propagating framework improvements to existing projects

When you improve a protocol, agent, or best practice in this template repo, copy the framework-level files into existing projects and commit the changes there.

Framework-level paths to propagate:

- `docs/workflow/`
- `.claude/agents/`
- `.claude/skills/`
- `.codex/skills/`
- `.cursor/rules/`
- `.cursor/agents/`
- `.cursor/commands/`
- `scripts/development-workflow/install-codex-skills.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/add-backlog-item.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/discover-workflow-state.sh`
- `scripts/development-workflow/check-workflow-branch.sh`
- `docs/best-practices/1-general.md`
- `docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md`
- `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md`

Project-specific paths to avoid overwriting:

- `docs/project/`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md`

#### Using the sync-template skill (Claude Code / Cursor)

If your project has the `.claude/skills/sync-template.md` skill, you can automate this process:

| Tool        | Command          |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Claude Code | `/sync-template` |
| Cursor      | `/sync-template` |

The skill compares your project against the template, shows exactly what changed (categorized by auto-apply vs. manual review vs. skipped), and applies updates only after your explicit approval. It also generates ready-to-use git instructions for branching, committing, and opening a PR.

On first run, the skill will ask you for the template source (local path or remote URL) and save it under `template.source` in `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` for future runs (`.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml` is gitignored).

### Backporting improvements from a project to the template

When you improve a framework file while working on a specific project, port the relevant changes back into this template repo via a normal PR (copy only the framework-level paths listed above, and avoid importing project-specific content).

### Setting GitHub as a template repository

To enable the **"Use this template"** button on GitHub:

1. Go to the repository **Settings**
2. Under **General**, check **"Template repository"**
3. Save

New projects will be created as independent repositories (not forks), with a clean Git history.
